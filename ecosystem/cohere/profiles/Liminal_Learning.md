> What we do: From worry to wonder
> 
> Leaving school is a step into the unknown. Life could be awesome… it could be terrible. Your whole adulthood seems to hinge on right now, but right now doesn't really make sense. What is a good life? What is a life that might feel good, even great? How can you know what to study, if you don't know yet what you'll like or be good at in a few years? Never mind the health of the planet, or politics, or robots taking over.
> 
> Liminal Learning is a way to navigate these questions, together, with a sense of wonder and play.
> 
> Our mission: A devotion to living well, together
> 
> Living well requires a shift in our relationship with the unknown. A shift from worry and alienation to wonder and collective experimentation.
> 
> As educators, our highest role is as liberators: seeing, revealing, and inspiring the unique gifts of each individual. In various industries, cultures, and roles, our founding team have experienced living within systems that have lost contact with this function, that indeed subdue and devalue the essential expression of life. We see a different path.
> 
> As a community, our commitment is to the pursuit and practice of meaning and wisdom. We hold these pursuits to be collective; fundamentally relational, social. In various ways, we’ve experienced living within systems that foster alienation, isolation, and the amputation of parts of life and self. We see a different way.
