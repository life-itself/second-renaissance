> "Global Action Plan is an environmental charity focused on issues where the connection between the health of people and our planet is most tangible.
> 
> Global Action Plan mobilises people and organisations to take action on the systems that harm us and our planet. Through our work we create the political and policy conditions for more radical action, connecting behaviour change to systems change. 
> 
> Our cycle of change involves three connected steps that influence systems change through mobilisation:
> 
> - Research - We identify why and how the system needs to change.
> - Collective action - We inspire and support people and organisations with the knowledge, resources, networks and agency to take action around this common goal.
> - Campaigns - We influence decision makers to change the systems that harm people and the environment."
