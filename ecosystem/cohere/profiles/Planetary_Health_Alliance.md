> Our Vision: A world where all people thrive by protecting and regenerating Earthâ€™s natural systems for generations to come.
> 
> Our Mission: To promote, mobilize, and lead an inclusive, transdisciplinary field of Planetary Health and its diverse science, stories, solutions, and communities to achieve the Great Transition, a comprehensive shift in how human beings interact with each other and Nature, in order to secure a livable future for humanity and the rest of life on Earth.
> 
> To accomplish our mission, we:
> - Encourage and empower a diverse global Planetary Health community that crosses sectors, disciplines, generations, worldviews, and geographies;
> - Advance Planetary Health understanding by convening knowledge holders as well as curating, synthesizing, and disseminating evidence to inform and activate the Planetary Health community and the broader society.
> - Facilitate the education and training of current and next generation Planetary Health practitioners through the development and curation of open-access resources, mentorship and leadership opportunities, and programs from primary to university levels.
> - Mainstream Planetary Health science, stories and solutions through broad public outreach and direct engagement with civil society, private sector, general public and governments;
