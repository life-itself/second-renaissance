> Our purpose is to empower our conscious evolution through the understanding, experiencing and embodying of unitive awareness. 
> 
> Our world-view drives our beliefs, thoughts, decisions, behaviours and words. Our current, dominant world-view is based on an illusion of separation, causing a collective dis-ease and now an existential threat to our future and that of our planetary home, Gaia.  A WholeWorld-View perceives the fundamentally unified nature of the whole - the me, the we, and the all. A WholeWorld-View offers the science, the movements, the people, tools and most importantly the authentic hope of unitive awareness.   
> 
> You have come to the right place if you're looking for:
> 
> - the latest unitive scientific breakthroughs and evidence of a conscious and evolutionary Universe
> - fellow communities, networks, tools and examples of how we can understand, experience and embody unitive awareness
> 
> Converging with universal spiritual experiences and wisdom teachings and based on the evidence of thousands of leading edge researchers, WholeWorld-View as a team and as a movement offer a ‘unifying underpinning and framework’ to support a unitive narrative that can inspire and empower, our conscious evolution.
