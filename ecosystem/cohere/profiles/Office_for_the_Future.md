>The Office for the Future understands that sensemaking is essential for a new future. We have the science and technological capacity to feed and empower every human being and at the same time we stand poised between a level of suffering, catastrophic and existential risk that’s unimaginable. [...]
>
>Our specialized leadership training is specifically designed to articulate a shared story that generates global coherence. At core of this new story, we need new first principles and first values which forms the basis of a new global ethos for a global civilization.
>
>We’ve come together at the Office for the Future to articulate **_new_** first principles and **_new_** first values to help companies, governments, NGO’s, civic and spiritual communities and other structure activate these first values and first principles in their core DNA. The result will be a local coherence within your organization which will in turn participate in generating the global coherence and cooperation necessary for the emergence of the next stage of humanity.
