> The Teilhard de Chardin Centre, opened in June 2023 in the heart of the technological and scientific center of Saclay, is a unique and innovative project carried out jointly by the Society of Jesus and the dioceses of Evry Corbeil-Essonnes, Paris, Nanterre and Versailles. It offers a space for meeting and dialogue to reflect on scientific and technological developments from a philosophical, ethical and spiritual point of view.
> 
> To contribute to kinship in a world confronted with complex and sometimes conflicting issues, the raison d'Ãªtre of the Teilhard de Chardin Centre is to help actors in the scientific and technical world to reflect on the meaning of their profession (current, and future for students), the ethics of their research and work, the ecological consequences of human activity as well as spiritual questions linked to scientific and technological development.
> 
> The Centre is also a place of spiritual life, welcoming the activities of student Christian communities, and offering those who wish it a place of renewal and prayer.
> 
> Its activities take the form of conferences, debate evenings, trainings, workshops, discussion meetings, etc. and are open to all: teachers and researchers, business professionals, students, the general public who are interested in scientific innovations, etc., whatever their religious and spiritual beliefs.
