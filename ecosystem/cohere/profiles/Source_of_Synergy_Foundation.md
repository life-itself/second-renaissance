>The Source of Synergy Foundation is a 501c3 not-for-profit educational organization whose purpose is to synergize individuals, organizations and efforts by tapping into the infinite source of collective consciousness, creativity and potential for the common good.

>Our intention is to support the release of synergistic energy that will exponentially expand and create a global ripple effect in planetary consciousness. We all recognize that when individuals, organizations, communities and nations unite in a shared sense of responsibility for the common good their collective efforts have a far greater effect on the whole. Recently, we have seen an extraordinary number of networks, alliances and coalitions of individuals and organizations uniting in a shared sense of responsibility to help solve some of the world’s most pressing problems--climate change, hunger, human rights violations, and conflicts. There is a great shift accelerating across the planet where the power of the collective spirit is activated. The Source of Synergy Foundation is dedicated to creating opportunities for synergy that support a conscious evolutionary movement for global transformation.
