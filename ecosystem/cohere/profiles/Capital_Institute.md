>The Capital Institute is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization reimagining our economic and financial systems to promote the transformation to a more just and regenerative world.

>The Capital Institute has pioneered a new space for holistic economic thought that draws on the latest science of living systems, global wisdom traditions, and 20 years of real world experience at the pillar of global finance on Wall Street.
>
>The Capital Institute encourages a **transformation of our economic system to achieve social and ecological regeneration**. We believe our finance-driven economic system is in urgent need of a regenerative model that must be aligned with the laws — not theories — of natural systems and our current scientific understanding of how the world works, which is remarkably aligned with the compassion embodied in all global wisdom traditions.
>
>We redefine wealth and reimagine finance in service to the emergence of an ecologically and socially regenerative economy. By addressing the root causes of climate change, economic injustice, and even pandemics, we promote the emergence of thriving communities and a flourishing planet.
>
>The Regenerative Economy we foresee is a powerful one, unleashing presently unseen potential, which is the source of Regenerative Age prosperity, and replacing no longer feasible extractive growth. This potential derives from the essence of our individual genius, the deep purpose of regenerative enterprise large and small, and must extend to the macro socio-economic system as a whole.

### Key People 

- John Fullerton, Founder & President

## Theory of Change 

>Today’s greatest challenge is to address the root cause of our systemic crises – today’s dominant (neoliberal) economic paradigm and the financial system that fuels it and rules it – by transitioning to a more effective economic system design that is regenerative and therefore sustainable over the long term.

The core idea of their "Regenerative Hypothesis" is: 
>We can use the universal principles and patterns underlying stable, healthy, and sustainable living and nonliving systems throughout the real world as a model for economic-system design.

They see the purpose of a Regenerative Economy as:
>to promote and sustain human prosperity and wellbeing in an economy of permanence.
