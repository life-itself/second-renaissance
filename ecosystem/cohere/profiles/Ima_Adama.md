> We create new narratives. This happens through two business areas: the publishing house (here you can find works on new narratives) and the experience spaces (here we playfully engage with existing and new narratives).
> 
> We open up spaces for thought and dialogue to research new narratives. We develop works and formats with which we can reach many people with these narratives.
