> The Applied Research Center for the Regeneration of Living Systems responds to the global metacrisis by fostering a holistic approach to revitalization. Nestled within the biodiverse and culturally rich Tarn-et-Garonne, we strive to empower civil society through research and co-development, integrating local and global stakeholders and knowledge, and bringing all of that together into real projects.
> 
> Our Center operates as a multi-site living laboratory for sustainability, focused on creating an integrated ecosystem where innovation thrives across various sectors. Facilities and initiatives include:
> 
> - Research & Education Hubs: Bridging theory and practice, addressing regenerative agriculture, renewable energy, and more to foster an informed, hands-on approach to ecological and societal revitalization.
> - Project Development: Aiming to activate the regional ecosystem, develop and promote sustainable living practices, encourage community engagement in environmental conservation, and expand its impact locally, nationally, and internationally.
> - Venture Studio: Bridging the worlds of research, idealism, politics, and business, the Center acts as an incubator for 'Zebras'—for-purpose companies committed to doing well by doing good. This initiative nurtures enterprises that balance profitability with purpose, creating a regenerative impact on both the economy and the community.
> - Enterprise Seminars & Retreats: Targeting knowledge exchange and skill development to empower entrepreneurs and business leaders with the tools they need to create sustainable impact. 
> - Hybrid International Conferences: Connecting virtual and physical realms for a far-reaching dialogue, fostering global collaborations and knowledge sharing.
> - Cultural Events & Spaces: Celebrating innovation through the arts, providing a platform for cultural expression that inspires and connects.
> - Unique Accommodations: Welcoming eco-tourists to immersive experiences, showcasing the Center's commitment to sustainable living and tourism.
