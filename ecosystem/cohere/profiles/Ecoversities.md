The Ecoversities Alliance is a trans-local community of over 200 transformative learning spaces from around the world who have been meeting and working together since 2015 through international and regional gatherings, learning exchanges, mutual aid campaigns, workshops, collaborative projects, learning journeys, film festivals and publications.
