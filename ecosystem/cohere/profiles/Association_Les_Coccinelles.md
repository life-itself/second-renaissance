>The Association "Les Coccinelles" is a little organisation with a big dream!
>
>We are a bunch of committed day dreamers, gate keepers, bridge builders, soul speakers, web weavers, light bearers, food growers, wound healers, trail blazers, truth sayers, life lovers & peace makers…  (as [“Climbing Poetree”](http://www.climbingpoetree.com/experience/read-poems/awaken/) would say) and we like to develop fun and positive pathways towards sustainability by using the great tool of Authentic Vocation and non-formal education, mixing these all up and creating new exciting moments of sharing knowledge and wisdom with especially young people, young adults, wise old adults people and children.
