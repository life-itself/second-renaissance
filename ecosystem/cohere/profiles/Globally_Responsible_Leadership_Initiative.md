> The Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative exists to catalyse the development of globally responsible leadership and practice in organisations and societies worldwide. It was co-founded by EFMD and UN Global Compact and in Strategic Partnership with EFMD and AACSB International.

>As eight billion of us collectively press against multiple planetary boundaries, with associated challenges to societal and economic stability, the time has come to activate our global responsibility gene.
>
>The GRLI holds and facilitates an inclusive and collective call for deep systemic change across three domains: how we live and make a living, how we learn, and how we lead.  Being consciously connected to one’s own self, to others in meaningful relationships and to the whole is a prerequisite for making that change a reality. This emergent paradigm represents a shift in consciousness from “I” to “We”, to “All of Us”.
