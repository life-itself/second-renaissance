> Leading Through Storms supports people to discover their best adaptive responses to the climate, ecological and related crises, building a more consciously interconnected society in community with others.
> 
> Leading through these troubled, troubling times can feel more like a burden than a privilege. Stepping in, caring to act, engaging wholeheartedly, we can find ourselves overwhelmed, in conflict, exhausted.
> 
> Leading Through Storms is not a journey to be undertaken alone.
> 
> We bring leaders together in community, helping to turn restless energies into spirited acts of leadership. Offering time and space to deeply explore all that matters, we support the inner work that is required for wise, outer-world leadership in our organisations and communities. [...]
> 
> In all that we do, we seek to create pockets today of the future we wish to see. 
> 
> People become more able to engage energetically and creatively with the complexity and uncertainty they face. 
> 
> Organisations are enabled to navigate complex, dilemma-ridden territory towards regenerative futures. [...]
> 
> Our work takes place in person, in nature and online. 
> Combining regular online gatherings and community programmes with immersive in-person retreats, we also work with organisations to tailor programmes suited to their unique circumstances.
