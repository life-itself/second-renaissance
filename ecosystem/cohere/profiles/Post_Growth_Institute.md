>The Post Growth Institute is an international, not for profit organization working to enable collective wellbeing within ecological limits.
>
>At the Post Growth Institute, our goal is to help guide the way to that more beautiful world your heart knows is possible. We help shift the worldview, so that more people understand the multitude of alternatives when we look at our challenges through an empowered, post-growth lens.
>
>A full circle, post-growth economy is already emerging, offering a pathway to collective thriving within ecological limits— an alternative to the current extractive, growth-dependent economy that leads to despair and division. The movement is driven by people who believe in an economy that naturally circulates money rather than concentrating it, an economy that values people’s needs ahead of corporate greed, an economy that gives more than it takes from our life-supporting planet.
