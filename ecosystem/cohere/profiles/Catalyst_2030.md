>Catalyst 2030 is a global movement of social change innovators. It comprises NGOs, social entrepreneurs, intermediaries, funders and other social change innovators, collaborating in this urgent moment to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

>Catalyst 2030 was started in July 2019 by leading social entrepreneurs from [[profiles/Ashoka]], Echoing Green, Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, Skoll Foundation and other other global networks of social entrepreneurs and social innovators. The movement was officially launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2020. A month later more than 80 co-founders held the inaugural meeting of Catalyst 2030 at the Althorp Estate in Northampton (UK) to craft a collective roadmap for the years ahead. It is currently being incubated by the One Family Foundation in Amsterdam (NL).

### Organisation Structure

>Catalyst 2030 operates as a distributed entity, without headquarters, rather than as a structured, formal organisation. This helps us to work more effectively towards collaborative systems change.
