>YxY began as a 3 day learning experience to evolve our conscious activism, radical reimagination and co-creative action to transform our education.  Now we are aiming to ignite a global movement to transform our learning and education!  We believe in a liberated world where education is an experience that serves all of us as young people, as well as our communities and the planet.  Letâ€™s take a step towards love, belonging and embodying an intentionally anti-oppressive world together.
