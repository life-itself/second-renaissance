> "Founded in 2012, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food is a strategic alliance for collective action on food systems transformation. Our work is grounded in our principles of food systems that are renewable, resilient, equitable, healthy, diverse, inclusive, and interconnected. At the heart of our work are our philanthropic foundation members, who work alongside a global Secretariat, along with our Allied Initiatives, partners in civil society, funder affinity groups and intermediaries, governments and the private sector, and global fora, including the UN FAO.
> 
> Working together as an alliance means our members can amplify their work, act together, and take a position on pressing global issues aligned with their own missions. Together, we transform food systems by strengthening the evidence for global systems change, convening key food system players in meaningful dialogue, and stimulating local and global action for transformational change. [...]
> 
> Our members work on a range of issues from agroecology and regenerative agriculture to aquatic and terrestrial foods, from addressing the links between the food system and the climate crisis to promoting human rights and food sovereignty."
