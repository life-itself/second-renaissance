>Heartfulness is a 100-year-old tradition that continues to evolve with the times, integrating scientific inquiry and time-honored contemplative practices. Certified trainers guide you to experience the subtle energy of Transmission, which awakens a deeper level of inner experience, authenticity, compassion, and awareness. Heartfulness practices expand your awareness, and develop well-being, contentment, calm, compassion, courage, and clarity. With this awakened potential, together we can create a world based on respect, peace and unity.

>Heartfulness emerged in the late 1800s in a small town called Fatehgarh on the Ganges River in the north of India. The practices are based on the ancient art of Transmission, a transformative yogic technique, which was rediscovered by Ram Chandra, who was known as Lalaji to his friends. He rediscovered Transmission when he was still a boy, and from an early age recognized the need for a simple and effective method of self-care that could be practised universally.
>
>Lalaji went on to distill a set of essential meditative practices from the great traditions of the past into a universal system suited to the needs of modern-day life, removing all unnecessary rituals and cultural beliefs. He trained many followers during his lifetime, and among them was Ram Chandra of Shahjahanpur, known to many as Babuji. In 1945, Babuji became Lalaji’s successor in the work of training and transmitting to the growing number of followers, and his work led to further refinement and evolution of the Heartfulness practices.
>
>In July 1945, Babuji founded the first Heartfulness organization in India – a non-profit for the well-being of people around the world. [...]
>
>The Heartfulness Movement has been active in peace building since 1957, when Babuji first contacted the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld to offer a practice for peace among all people of the world. [...] Today, there are Heartful Communication programs offered in all regions of the world, offering people a way to resolve conflict and bring harmony.
