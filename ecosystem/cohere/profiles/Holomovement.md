> The Holomovement is a social movement that awakens us to our interconnectedness, igniting a critical mass of collaborative action serving the good of the whole. 
> 
> We are a global community of innovators, change-makers, compassionate individuals, businesses and nonprofits drawn to creating a better world. The Holomovement is ALL OF US.
> ‍
> While there are stewards supporting the movement, there are no boards or governing bodies holding ownership of the Holomovement itself. 
> 
> The Holomovement is an experiment in joyful collaboration--a named space for coalition and shared collective wisdom--rather than a non-profit or organizational entity.
