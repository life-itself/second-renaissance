Sprouts is a learning community inspired by Schumacher College based at Froidefontaine Farm, an agroecological farm in Belgium.

>The Sprouts offer an educational programme with transformative courses for ecological, social and personal change. We apply a range of teachings and learning methods, varying from lectures to reflective inquiry, with an emphasis on action in the participantsâ€™ own lives. The connection with nature is at the heart of all courses while there is always a focus on how to be and act in a changing world. We are convinced that these competences are key to build a sustainable future.
