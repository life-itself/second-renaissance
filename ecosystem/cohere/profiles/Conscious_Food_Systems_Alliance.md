>The Conscious Food Systems Alliance (CoFSA), convened by UNDP, is a movement of food, agriculture, and consciousness practitioners united around a common goal: **to support people from across food and agriculture systems to cultivate the inner capacities that activate systemic change and regeneration.**
>
>It aims at establishing the cultivation of inner capacities as a key **evidence-based approach** to envision and create regenerative food systems, while building **legitimacy** **and understanding** for this approach.

### What They Do

>CoFSA brings together an intentional community of peers, where individuals and organizations can connect and practice together, learn and exchange knowledge, support and inspire each other, as well as collaborate to build conscious food systems.

>CoFSA members pioneer the integration of consciousness approaches and practices into food systems, through a global portfolio of interventions, including the delivery of trainings, coaching and facilitation services, supported by research and learning frameworks.  
>
>Interventions are led by members, who collaborate to develop and implement pilots and prototypes, with a commitment to share learning with the Alliance. The role of the Secretariat is to advise on the design and support members to form partnerships, access tools and expertise, and share lessons learnt through the community.

### Areas of Intervention

>CoFSA Interventions focus on working with governments, companies, farmers and development practitioners to support food systems transformation across three main areas:  
>
>Food Systems Policy and Pathways
>
>- Food Policy Reform: _to improve the quality of interaction of policy-makers, and to support them in designing policies that integrate a more ‘compassionate’ and systemic approach._
>- Multi-stakeholder Dialogues: _to create safe, connecting, and transformative spaces for conscious multi-stakeholder dialogues in food systems contexts._
>
>Sustainable Landscapes
>
>- Conscious Farming and Local Community Development: _to improve the wellbeing and resilience of farmers and their communities, and help them cultivate regenerative mindsets and agricultural practices._ 
>- Revitalizing and Strengthening Traditional Wisdom: _to promote traditional cultural practices and knowledge that support regenerative food systems_
>
>Supply Chain Transformation 
>
>- Cultural Transformation of Organizations: _​​to support the cultivation of regenerative mindsets, values and skills that catalyze supply chain transformation._
