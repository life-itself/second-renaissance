>K9 Coliving is a bubbly, thriving and unique home for 50ish lucky K9ers. 20 different nationalities, as young as 6 to 50+ years old, Phd student, architects, yoga teachers, doctors, psychologists, artists, designers, developers, entrepreneurs and everything in between.
>
>Many of the house values, the personal & professional activities as well as events organized by the residents in and outside the house, are driven by a common interest in topics such as personal growth and development, social impact and co-creation. Some of us are involved in initiatives such as the Inner [Development Goals](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/), the [Ekskaretfoundation](http://www.ekskaretfoundation.com/), or [Selfleaders.com](https://selfleaders.com/) - that both influence the K9 community and are influenced by it. By engaging in such projects, we want to look beyond the walls of the coliving space and into a more collaborative Society in the (near) future.

>There are a few key words at K9: ‘co-creation’ and ‘intentional’ being just two of them. Those who live in the House have intentionally chosen to co-create their lives and the life of the house with others.
>
>This is not a small commitment and that is why we are a ‘long term’ coliving. Most of our residents stay at least one year, usually much longer.

>K9 organisational governance is loosely based on the Holacracy method. Meaning that there are no leaders. The authority and decision making is shared between everyone in the house distributed through self organized teams and individual roles.
