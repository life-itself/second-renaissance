> WELLBEING INSPIRES WELLDOING
> 
> We are catalysing a culture where changemakers are well and their work is thriving.
> 
> Changemakers are on the frontlines of the worldâ€™s biggest challenges. They are activists, community health workers, social entrepreneurs, teachers, nurses, social workers, and much more.  Their work builds a more caring and healthy world.  But the reality is that, doing this brave and challenging work, changemakers are at great risk of difficulties such as burnout and depression.  Trauma is often present for them and in the communities where they work.
> 
> We are building a culture of inner wellbeing where changemakers have support to take care of themselves and where it is clear that tending to their wellbeing profoundly helps both them and their work.
> 
> We are a global network of over 1,200 organisations including grassroots networks, global organisations, foundations, intermediaries, universities, and progressive businesses. Together we are:
> - Deepening the knowledge base for wellbeing at the heart of social change
> - Learning and acting together to support changemakers and their organisations
> - Convening Summits to galvanise a wellbeing culture regionally and globally
> - Mainstreaming a wellbeing and social change narrative
