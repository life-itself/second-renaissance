> "What?
> 
> Simpol is an international association of citizens who use their votes in a new way to drive their politicians, parties, and eventually governments towards cooperation to solve the most pressing global issues of our time, such as climate change, fair corporate taxation, mass migration and so on.
> 
> How?
> 
> By joining Simpol, citizens in democratic countries give strong voting preference at all future national elections to politicians or parties that have pledged to implement Simpol's policies simultaneously alongside other governments. So, politicians or parties who sign Simpol's Pledge enhance their chances of getting our votes, while those that donâ€™t risk losing out to those that do. As democratic governments are driven to sign the Pledge, non-democratic governments will not want to be left out. They need solutions to global problems too."
