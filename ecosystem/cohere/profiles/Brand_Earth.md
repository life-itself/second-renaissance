- Harry Uvegi, Founder

## Theory of Change 

They have a model called the 'dandelion economy' which is a metaphorical way to describe a localized, regenerative economic model, wherein wealth is used to rejuvenate and sustain Indigenous and local communities much like a dandelion spreading its seeds to give new life.

In this model, wealth is primarily invested locally, instead of being concentrated in large corporations or distant markets.
