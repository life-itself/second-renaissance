> The Global Center for Indigenous Leadership and Lifeways (GCILL) is an informal umbrella created to support long-term and short-term projects that educate and inform people about Indigenous ways to raise human consciousness and  co-create a harmonious relationship with Mother Earth.
> 
> The initial focus of GCILL is to advance the capacity to share the messages of wisdom keepers, including the work of  Ilarion 'Kuuyux' Merculieff while helping other-selves and Mother Earth.
