>We provide resources to educate and inform organisations about environmental sustainability.

>**A new approach to sustainable transition training**
>At AXA Climate, we have over 50 employees worldwide dedicated to training employees on environmental issues and transforming their jobs. Our aim: to give your employees the desire and the means to become involved in the sustainable transformation of your business.

>In 2021, we realized that there was a lack of tools to broadly engage employees on environmental issues in companies and public institutions. To remedy this issue, we launched the Climate School, which aims to explain the impacts of sustainable transformation for companies, businesses and employees alike.
>
>Since then, we have created new formats to meet the needs of our clients seeking more sector-specific knowledge or to engage their employees with more varied content. Today, we enable HR Departments to support the skills development of their employees worldwide, and ESG Managers to involve all their staff in their sustainable transition approach.

Their 'Manifesto':

>**We** see planetary boundaries as a framework within which human activities, especially business activities, must be observed for long-term global sustainability.
>
>**We** are convinced that organisations must transition to a sustainable business models.
>
>**We** believe that organisations need to train their employees and stakeholders in order to succeed in that transition.
>
>**We** contribute to this need for training by offering science based accessible content to your entire workforce.
>
>**We** know that training alone will not transform companies and the society. There is a growing ecosystem trying to shift we [sic] approach things. We are their allies.
