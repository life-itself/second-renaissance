> Reinventing Society is a non-profit and independent think tank founded in late 2020. Our mission is to accompany people into a regenerative society. To do this, we develop positive visions of the future , accompany change processes and impart future skills. We see our organization itself as a real-world laboratory in which new empirical knowledge is created.
> 
> Our team consists of economists and social scientists, sustainability and environmental researchers, experts from communication and media, psychology and politics.
> 
> Our perspective on social change is holistic and includes the three levels of individual, organization and society. With a systemic view, we make interactions visible and develop realistic solutions depending on the situation and overall context. We combine a playful attitude with professional expertise and human depth.
> 
> We are in a phase of great upheaval. Various crises lead to the end of old structures. We sense that something new wants to be created. Our work is dedicated to the creation of a new world, a world of beauty, regeneration, connection and vitality.
