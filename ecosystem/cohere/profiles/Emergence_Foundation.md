> Emergence Foundation is a non-profit organisation focused on fostering personal, societal, and global transformation through highlighting unique expressions of the nexus of inner and outer change, something we call the X Factor. Our mission is to help create a more compassionate, equitable and sustainable world by supporting these innovative projects and change-makers in areas such as education, community building, arts, ecology and spiritual growth. We believe that transformative change begins with individuals and communities, and our work emphasises the importance of collaboration, creativity and consciousness in regenerating global culture.

> Emergence Foundation is a UK-based educational charity and grant-giving organisation which has offered financial support to individual and group projects and initiatives that are aligned with its core mission and guiding principles.

> The Foundation aims to support organisations, charities, social enterprises and projects that are engaged in and committed to the uplift of individuals, organisations and culture at large: projects that affect a shift in consciousness and perspective based on the fundamental unity of all life, providing a force of positive change in the world.
