>The Pocket Project was founded by Thomas Hübl and Yehudit Sasportas to help induce a shift from trauma-inducing to trauma-informed, trauma sensitive and, finally, trauma-integrating institutions and societies.
>
>We are a non-profit, non-governmental organization and are funded entirely by the generous contributions of financial donors.

>OUR VISION
>
>We restore fragmentation by addressing and integrating individual, ancestral and collective trauma. We heal the wounds from the past, thus supporting humanity on its path of collaboration, innovation and emergence.
>
>OUR MISSION
>
>We raise awareness and train civil society and professionals about the global impact of and processes for integration of collective trauma. We develop trauma-informed social impact projects.

## Theory of Change

>We cultivate presence, relational sensing and coherence in individuals and groups.
>
>Our work rests on the premise, supported by scientific evidence, that unresolved systemic, intergenerational trauma delays the development of the human family, harms the natural world, and inhibits our evolutionary movement. We support change agents and leaders to become trauma-informed. Through precision of relational and systemic sensing, ‘pockets of healing’ can emerge in communities, organisations and countries. When the level of trust and coherence in such a community of practice rises, underlying fields of trauma can be addressed. Over time, the group develops an increased ability to host waves of intensity and create a space for ethical transgression to grow into ethical learning. A deeper acknowledgement and digestion of content and experiences that could not be processed before can unfold. ‘Pockets of healing’ become able to integrate ‘pockets of trauma’. The creative and innovative potential of communities, organisations and countries grows.
