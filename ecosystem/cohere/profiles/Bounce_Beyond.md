>Bounce Beyond is a progressive agency in service to people and initiatives who are accelerating systemic transformation. We are co-creating a shift from exploitive [sic] systems and power structures towards socially just and equitable societies in a flourishing natural world.

https://www.bouncebeyond.global/

>Bounce Beyond works with initiatives to accelerate pathways to regenerative, life-centered, wellbeing economies through catalytic actions. We enable them to catalyze powerful [transformation systems](https://www.bouncebeyond.global/transformations-systems) to collaboratively accelerate transformation of a geography, such as a political- or bio-region, an issue such as climate change or racial injustice, and/or sector such as fisheries or health care.  We work with six activities to realize life-centered futures.

'What We Do', https://www.bouncebeyond.global/values/mission

These six activities are: 
1. Seeing (Connecting)
2. Sensemaking (Connecting)
3. Designing Adaptive Pathways (Cohering)
4. Enacting Adaptive Pathways (Cohering)
5. Co-creating Transformation Capacities (Amplifying)
6. Developing Transformation Infrastructure (Amplifying)
