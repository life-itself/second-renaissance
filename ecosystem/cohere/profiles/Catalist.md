## Theory of Change 

>The Problem: Technology isn't designed to maximize collective intelligence, collaboration, and coordinated action towards what matters most.  
>
>The Solution: Creating a value-driven ecosystem of tools designed to educate and unite the change-makers of the world, liberate us from our screens, and empower the action needed to preserve life on planet earth. Trove is one tool that is part of the Catalist platform cooperative. Trove combines crowd-sourced community directory and social bookmarking tools, to create intention-based connections, foster collaboration, and catalyze coordinated action.
