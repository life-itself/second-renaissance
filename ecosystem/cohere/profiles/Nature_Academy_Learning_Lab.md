> We want to inspire, strengthen and educate people to be a positive force for societal change and contribute to a more sustainable global community. Therefore, we assist leaders, individuals, and organisations to develop their skills and capacities for transformative learning.
> The Nature Academy also provides methods and tools for inner development, abilities that are increasingly necessary to reach and live up to global sustainability goals.

> In our vision, people learn in and from nature; we let ourselves be inspired by new, exciting developments and innovations from the genius of life and nature. With this attitude, we begin to respect, revere, and be thankful for life and make decisions for future generations in mind.
