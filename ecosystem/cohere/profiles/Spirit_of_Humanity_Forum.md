>The Spirit of Humanity Forum started as an idea from a group in the Gulf State of Oman. Given its role as a peacemaker in the region, it seemed an obvious place for bringing together leaders to explore the role of spiritual values in decision-making. Iceland was also on the horizon for this work which was further explored by the Brahma Kumaris and Education for Peace. The name was chosen to reflect the deep exploration of the connection between our inner spiritual values and the world around us.

>The Forum focuses on spirituality in leadership, and explores new forms of governance underpinned by care, respect, trust, dialogue and relationships.

The organisation's aim is:

>To offer a global platform for leaders and change-makers seeking to contribute towards a lasting transformation in the world in which core human values such as love, respect, solidarity and compassion become integrated in our decision-making and relational processes, enabling systemic change in organisations, communities and nations. This is part of our ‘duty of care’ for the Earth and for Humanity at large.

The organisation's ethos is:

>Humanity is moving towards a new paradigm based on core human values, in particular, love, compassion and peacefulness. As far as possible, the Forum seeks to model the emergent new paradigm as it is unfolding.
