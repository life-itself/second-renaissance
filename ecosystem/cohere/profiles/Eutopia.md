## Theory of Change 

- Eutopia aims to increase collaboration with other universities in Europe so as to collaborate on particular problems- like, for example, climate change. If anything has become  clear in the past few years, it is that certain challenges, like climate change, cannot be approached  in silos, but instead require careful and meaningful coordination. 
- Their key principles can be found here: https://eutopia-university.eu/english-version/about-us/mission-and-vision
- The rector of VUB, recently called for a 'second renaissance' in education, and Life Itself also uses this term to consider our current moment.
