### The Earth Charter document

>The Earth Charter (EC) is a document with sixteen principles powering a global movement. The EC enunciates the values and principles by which sustainable development can be achieved. When you apply it to your business, school or community, you begin turning conscience into action to make all life on Earth thrive.
>
>The EC is an ethical foundation for actions to build a more just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. It articulates a mindset of global interdependence and shared responsibility. It offers a vision of hope and a call to action.
>
>The EC is a product of a decade-long, worldwide, cross-cultural dialogue on common goals and shared values. It is used as an educational instrument; as a reference and tool in the development of policies, planning; and decisions and in many other ways.
