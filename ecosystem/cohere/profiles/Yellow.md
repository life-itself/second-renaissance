>**A complex world**
>
>In 2022 it is more obvious than ever how **complex** the world is.
>This complexity prevents us from simply engineering a more bountiful and beautiful future. Much of what is interesting or valuable happens obliquely, in ways we cannot predict or explain.
>The command and control that we hanker after is unattainable: dubbed by our friend Chris Kutarna 'the managerial fantasy'.
>Moreover, the pursuit of this idea is no longer enlightening - it is fruitless, even punishing.
>It creates distress on the individual, organisational and planetary scales.
>Yet we are trapped.
>We are steeped in a way of thinking and acting that runs so deep, and has been so successful, that our instinctive, almost our only response, is to try harder.
>
> **Where is the space?**
>
>It is hard to find a space to make different sense of things.
>Where might we do that?
>How?
>With whom?
>Existing institutions and organisations are built for the way things have been - so they are caught in existing ways of thinking and acting.
>However willing they are, the kinds of changes needed are unlikely to begin with them.
>
>**A creative response**
>
>Yellow is a creative response to this challenge.
>It is a carefully curated space, designed for people to think; together.
>A space to explore, discover, question and challenge.
>A space of 'not-knowing', as well as 'knowing'.
>Of unlearning as well as learning.
>A space which is empty in one sense and full in another.
>If we are to prosper in a world which is beyond our control, such spaces are vital.
>Sometimes it isn't the answers that you need to find.
>It is the questions. And a place to explore them.
