> Dark Matter Labs (Dm) is working on what is needed to manifest transformations to our food, housing, land, material and nature systems towards a future of mutual thriving.  
> 
> In doing this, we analyse the shifts it requires in the underlying ‘dark matter’ - monetary, economic, governance, regulatory and policy systems - to make this possible, and we work with partners to demonstrate these alternatives in neighbourhoods, cities and bioregions. We share these insights openly for mutual learning.

> We’re establishing toolkits and blueprints, pilots, and case studies, supporting communities and institutions with applications, digital products and civic technologies that challenge established thought and demonstrate that an alternative is possible.

## Theory of Change
  
> We’re working to initiate a _[boring revolution](https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956)_[︎](https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956) that will propel wider societal transition. We began as a five-person experiment in London and we've become a global, multi-disciplinary, 60-person team with specialisms ranging across financing and lawmaking to economic art and data science.  
> 
> We don’t profess to know all the answers, but we’re continuing to ask the questions. We’re looking to work openly and collaboratively, sharing any findings and discoveries, developing a learning community and encouraging likeminded collaborators to pick up the work and apply it within their own contexts and geographies.
