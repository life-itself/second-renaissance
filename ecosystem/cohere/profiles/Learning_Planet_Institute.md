> Since 2006, the Learning Planet Institute has been dedicated to reinventing learning for all ages (lifelong learning) through collective intelligence in order to build sustainable & inclusive learning societies able to rise to the complex challenges we face. 
> 
> The Institute’s mission is to explore, research and share new ways of learning and cooperating in order to respond to the needs of the youth and the planet. By encouraging and disseminating a culture, methods and tools for empowerment, it transforms organisations. Ultimately, it leads communities and supports “Learning Planetizens” to take care of themselves, others and the planet. 
> 
> To achieve its goals, the Learning Planet Institute creates research and educational programmes based on interdisciplinarity, diversity and initiative.
