> With only 13% of people engaged at work, let's face it--how we manage and design organizations simply is not working. We've been treating organizations as if they are machines, pushing productivity and efficiency at the expense of long-term health. In this model, humans are resources that must be aligned on an org chart -- like cogs in a machine. But organizations are not machines.

> Organizations are complex living systems. And living systems require a very different management and design approach.
> 
> nRhythm helps organizations make the necessary shifts in their design and operations to align with a living systems approach. We call organizations who embrace this approach Regenerative Organizations.
