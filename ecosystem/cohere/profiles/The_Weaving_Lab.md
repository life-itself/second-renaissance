> We are a Network of Individuals and Collectives weaving Systemic Change and supporting each other in this Journey. Weaving entails raising awareness of our interdependence with each other and the rest of nature; fostering purposeful and synergistic collaborations; as well as developing learning cultures for teams and communities. We see weaving as an essential process for systemic change.

> Our story is a collective journey of weavers across the globe coming together for the shared purpose of advancing the field of weaving. The Weaving Lab was launched in 2018 and our community has since grown to 300+ members from around the world. We are community builders, network conveners, social innovators and change-makers who want to experiment and learn how to become better weavers

We cultivate spaces and projects for learning, connection and innovation that develop meaningful relationships between people, ideas, teams, projects, organizations, networks, places and nature.
