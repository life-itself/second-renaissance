## Theory of Change 

>The Embassy proceeds from the knowledge that the world we live in is undivided and whole, and at present the only really urgent task is to prevent the dangers presented to its existence by the consumerist activities of humans. Overcoming all kinds of disunity, disconnectedness, alienation caused by shallow outlook on the world is an indispensible precondition of it. Development and Life create unity.
