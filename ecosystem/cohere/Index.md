## Cohere + project 

The overall objectives of the Cohere+ project are:

1. To increase and enhance the self-knowledge and self-awareness of key actors and organisations in the European transformational social change field, so that the field is more visible to itself and its effectiveness in strategic alignment is improved;
    
2. To support and facilitate greater connections and more effective transdisciplinary and transnational collaborations within the field;
    
3. To increase the visibility and accessibility of the field to broader European society so as to increase participation and boost its potential for impact;
    
4. To educate change agents and citizens within and beyond the field, to build the fieldâ€™s spheres of influence and thus leverage our collective power to co-create the future Europe we want to live in.
