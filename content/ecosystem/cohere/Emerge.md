>Emerge is a network responding to the question of what is happening within, between and beyond human beings in a civilisation that appears to be dying. We connect pioneers, seekers, innovators and their initiatives. We highlight what we share and seek to make visible the patterns that connect us. We help each other to respond to the most urgent challenges of our time. Together, we will sow the seeds of a new civilisation.

>The emergence of a more conscious society has already begun. Emerge connects transformative and inspirational innovators and initiatives across the globe. We spotlight the most daring pathfinders and visionaries who are using systems thinking, driving spiritual renewal or personal and cultural transformation, and who lovingly seduce cynical minds into seeing more beautiful alternative worlds.

>We believe that inner change and social change are interlinked. Shaped by biological, social and psychological forces, we are embodied, encultured and embedded. If we want to save our souls, systems and societies, we need to foster our willingness to engage with complexity. We must re-learn to dance with uncertainty, to listen to the future and to combine insights from multiple domains in daring new ways. Perhaps most importantly, we must find new ways to connect with each other.
