> Embercombe is a beautiful 50 acre [[rewilding]] estate on the edge of Dartmoor. It is a place to find a deep connection with nature – wild nature around us and wild nature within us.
>
> We run various programmes, courses and events each year to help you connect to yourself, to nature, and to community. It is a place to breathe, to reconsider, to regenerate and to relearn. It is a place to find the gifts that we have to offer right now in the beauty and peace of Nature.

## Founding Principles

- The Children's Fire pledge: "No law, no decision, no action of any kind shall be taken that will harm the children, now or ever."
- 'The twin trail of inner growth and outer action'
(https://embercombe.org/who-we-are/)

## Key People

- Mac Macartney, Founder
## Theory of Change

The 'Twin Trail of inner healing and outer action'
- "By exploring our inner landscape we find out what it is that we truly _love_. When we know what we love we know what we stand by. We know what we stand _for_. We begin to understand our unique gifts, our responsibilities, and what we can offer to the world. We reconnect to our earth, we find our songs, we find our old stories, we find each other, we find ourselves."
- "The inner path of our growing, unfolding, learning and healing enables our gift of outer action in the world. It is the basis for bringing our gifts, our education and our wounds into alignment with the work we offer. In this way we can meet every challenge and bring ourselves fully, leading ourselves and others on a path of positive action." [3][3]

Connection --> Community --> Sustainability
- Support people to cultivate more deep and authentic connection with themselves, with others, and with nature [1][1]
- By growing connection, start building and deepening in community, that is, interconnectedness and interdependence. [2][2]
- Through this connection to the essence of what it means to be human in interdependent community with other humans and nature, " we will be more effective communicators and thereby become leaders for change. In this way we can work towards true sustainability." [2][2]
