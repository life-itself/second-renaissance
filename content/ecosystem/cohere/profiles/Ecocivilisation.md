> "Ecocivilisation is a movement
> 
> The ecocivilizational community is an intuitive response to the state of the world in the 21st century. It operates as an international community of various initiatives, visions, projects, individuals, and networks seeking common ways of engagement to aid the planet and humanity in successful development.
> 
> What we stand for
> We advocate for tangible core values: the universal right to clean water, the universal right to clean air, the universal right to public space, and the universal right to knowledge as prerequisites toward a civilization based on relationships.
> 
> The Core Model of Ecocivilisation
> Ecocivilization is based on a model of a possible new social structure that focuses on the fundamental pillars of humanity and the planet we call our home – planet Earth. It focuses on beings, spaces, communities, consciousness, and relationships as connecting dynamic structures that sustain the development of life."
