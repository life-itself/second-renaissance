>The Si Network is a global online platform supporting individuals and organizations on their journey of learning and applying systems innovation ideas and methods towards addressing complex challenges. Our purpose is to build the world’s capacity for systems innovation, so as to better understand and address complex challenges and co-create a world where systems work for all.
>
>We work to advance the area of systems innovation in theory and practice through awareness raising, the development of educational content, a community of practice and the development of spaces for collaboration around key challenges.

The platform contains many educational resources. The network also offers different 'hubs', organised around different themes/sectors. One example is the "Cities Hub" which shares information on systems change for cities, in which there are roughly two posts a week, mostly from moderators, on content about cities and systems innovation. The platform seems to have a good amount of involvement.

## Theory of Change 

- They understand "systems innovation" as "a new approach to innovation that tries to tackle complex social and environmental challenges through the use of more holistic & innovation driven approaches. It is a kind of innovation that aims to change  the underlying structure of a system, thus potentially enabling a more transformational kind of change"
