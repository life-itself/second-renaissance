>We are a geographically distributed community of seekers and friends, connecting face-to-face via video calls. We connect and reflect together in relationship as a catalyst to self-development, increased awareness, greater integrity. We relish our diversity across gender, generation, nation, ethnicity, religious (or non-) background, socioeconomic status, and other perspectives increasingly. Some of us bring backgrounds in various related fields or scenes: adult development psychology, relational practices (e.g. Authentic Relating, Circling, Collective Presencing), and the "sensemaking web" (e.g. Game B, Integral, Metamodernism). Regardless, all of us are united in one thing above all else: seeking to grow.

>Our values orient around _awareness_, _acceptance_, and _integrity_ as big themes. Awareness means consciousness and attention: taking the "balcony view" perspective on ourselves and on the people and systems we're intereacting with. Acceptance means facing reality - being able to be with what is, as it is, without deceiving ourselves. From awareness and acceptance flow greater capacity for compassion, empathy, and our ability to hold our intentions as objects of reflection, in integrity with our layers of body-mind-self, our personal relationships, and our interfaces with the larger systems we're a part of.
