## Theory of Change

**The root cause of unhealthy cultural patterns is separation from self, others, and nature. Therefore, we need to cultivate healthier relationships (to self, others, and nature).**

> Systems transformation is about addressing the root causes of separation (from self, others, and nature), which keep us locked into re-enacting unhealthy patterns. We cultivate regenerative, holistic and equitable ways of relating in order to create systemic transformation.
'Approach', https://www.indigenousandmodern.com/approach/

- "We develop disruptive projects to **shift extractive paradigms towards regenerative systems**"
- "Our trans-disciplinary methodology combines [[indigenous]] knowledge, [[presencing]] practices, and [[nature]]-inspired innovation with modern [[systems thinking]], network leadership, [[neuroscience]] and [[eco-psychology]]."
