Some of their projects range from "Transforming Food Systems in Brazil' to "Urban Water Resilience in Africa".

They are involved with systems change projects at a number of different levels, and take a consulting role in order to provide solutions. They are involved in a number of different sectors, and have practical experience in what systems change looks like at different scales. 

They have a branch called "Social Labs" which aims to "bring together people from across the system to seek the root causes behind their problems and then collaborate on devising and testing solutions aimed at key leverage points. This change work continues in the “lab” of the real world – over time and in context."
