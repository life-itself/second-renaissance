>Transition Network is a charity which works to support the Transition movement, amplify stories of community-led change, and nurture collaborations across difference to challenge us all to reimagine and rebuild our world.  Read more about our organisational purpose [here](https://transitionnetwork.org/about-the-movement/the-charity/purpose/).
>
>We work with, and alongside, a grass-roots movement of independent Transition community groups and Transition Hubs in many countries.  We aim to evolve as an organisation alongside the Transition movement, which is spreading, evolving and deepening, while being clear about the particular functions that we undertake.
>
>A strength of the Transition movement is that people working at local community level can learn from others in communities around the world. Transition Network is constantly looking for ways to encourage and enable the sharing of ideas, learning and support, across and beyond the Transition movement.  Being part of a network means we can create change more quickly and more effectively, drawing on each other’s experiences and insights.
>
>Transition Network was established as a company limited by guarantee in March 2007, and registered as a charity in March 2009.

### What is the Transition Movement?

>Transition is a movement that has been growing since 2005. Community-led Transition groups are working for a low-carbon, socially just future with resilient communities, more active participation in society, and caring culture focused on supporting each other.  Their approach is based in the [Transition Principles](https://transitionnetwork.org/about-the-movement/what-is-transition/principles-2/).  
>
>In practice, they are using participatory methods to imagine the changes we need, setting up renewable energy projects, re-localising food systems, and creating community and green spaces.  They are nurturing the Inner Transition of the cultural and mindset changes that support social and environmental change.  They are sparking entrepreneurship, working with municipalities, building community connection and care, repairing and re-skilling.  Find out more about the [characteristics](https://transitionnetwork.org/about-the-movement/what-is-transition/characteristics/) of Transition.    
>
>The community level of scale has huge potential to influence change and is a crucial part of developing and guiding social and economic systems toward sustainability, social justice and equity. There is an increasing recognition that top-down approaches are not sufficient alone to affect change and need to be combined with community-level responses.  
>
>It’s an approach that has spread now to over 48 countries, in thousands of groups: in towns, villages, cities, Universities, schools.  Around the world, there are 23 Transition Hubs that support and connect Transition groups in their country/region and connect internationally.
