> "A home for societal transformation
> 
> Atelier Gardens is an iconic 6-acre film campus overlooking Berlin’s famous Tempelhof airport. Known as “UFA Studios Tempelhof” and later as “Berliner Union-Film” or “BUFA”, it has been home to the pioneers of film, and is steeped in more than 100 years of film and TV.
> 
> Rekindling the site’s pioneering and creative spirit, we are opening up the space, delivering a global home for the pioneers of profound societal change. The campus is welcoming activists, social entrepreneurs, documentary film makers, human rights lawyers, educators, growers, artists, etc. to tell the next chapter of its story, together.
> 
> The site’s motto “Celebrating Soul, Soil, Society” underlines the ambition for a holistic approach to regenerative life in the city, and the belief that human beings, in principle, are capable of making a helpful contribution to life on Earth."
