> True to our name, the Guerrilla Foundation resources activists & grassroots movements in building pockets of resistance while carrying out radical societal transformations needed to cultivate a living, circular economy with a deeply democratic society that prioritises social & ecological wellbeing.

 https://guerrillafoundation.org/

> The Guerrilla Foundation supports activists and grassroots movements working towards bringing about major systemic change across Europe in line with frameworks such as the Just Transition, the Great Transition, Buen Vivir, intersectional thinking, new municipalism. We see people's movements as a key vehicle for redirecting the global trajectory toward a socially equitable, culturally enriched, and ecologically resilient planetary civilization. We fund and support social movements and urgent actions in order to weave a new narrative shifting from an extractive economy, exploitative labour, and militaristic governance to a living economy with cooperative labour and a deeply democratic society that prioritises social and ecological wellbeing.   In short, we: 1. Make grants to advance the work of grassroots social movements for systems change. 2. Radically change philanthropy and work with people of wealth & privilege to increase the pie for social justice grant-making in Europe. 3. Tell stories to re-articulate distorted narratives and uplift radical, imaginative, moral ones. 4. Build networks, while reorganising power and fostering learning in the field. 5. Live our values in our day-to-day work and processes.
> 
> Our values are a constant challenge and compass. They guide us in how we go about our mission as well as our day-to-day work whether that is making grants, changing philanthropy, writing & storytelling, and how we show up in relationship with people.
