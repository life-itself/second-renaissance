> "A resource of film-based courses and tools grounded in mindfulness, lucid dreaming, shadow integration, compassion, mindful activism, sustainability and all things that help wake up the mind.
> 
> Our aim is to inspire mindful change and to help the world wake up collectively.
> 
> We believe that global change can only begin through a change in our own minds. We hope to present a resource that can help support inner change. To change your mind is to change the world.
> 
> We welcome the shift from the old paradigm of competition to a new one of cooperation, therefore we invite other organizations, individuals and communities to join us on the Awake Academy journey!"
