>Our mission is to support people to _explore_, _exchange_, and _expand_ their worldviews, empowering them to _enact_ a better world.
>
>_Worldviews_ refer to the ‘big stories’ through which humans make sense of their experience and world. As our worldviews define what we consider true, worthwhile, and moral, they shape our lives and world to a great extent. In the words of cultural historian Richard Tarnas: “worldviews create worlds.”
>
>Worldviews are often seen as both _root causes_ of our world’s crisis as well as _deep leverage points_ for addressing it. Examining them may therefore offer potent pathways forward.
>
>We develop transformative learning tools and trajectories that invite people to
>
>- _Explore_ the big, existential questions that worldviews give answers to;
>- _Exchange_ constructively with those who think differently;
>- _Expand_ their worldviews to include nature and the planet, and
>- _Enact_ their views in service of a better world for all.

### Worldview Assessment

They look to provide integral spiral-dynamic-y worldview stages assessment.

Tests are here [https://wvtest.com/](https://wvtest.com/ "https://wvtest.com/") and looks like the tests are paid for e.g. €99 / year.

Very interesting to see substantial data in the results (66k results).

Classify into 4 worldviews:

- Traditional (Pre-modern)
- Modern
- Post-modern
- Integrative

> Data-analysis by political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world. As their results show, massive cultural change is observed over time and throughout the world, with a shift from traditional values dominant in more agrarian societies (resonant with the traditional worldview), to secular-rational values in industrial societies (modern worldview). As well as a shift from survival values to self-expression values dominant in post-industrial societies (postmodern worldview). This suggests at least the traditional, modern, and postmodern worldviews are observed beyond the West as well. The integrative worldview is not (yet?) clearly distinguished by the World Values Survey, but has been extensively described by various philosophers (for example by Jean Gebser, and more contemporarily by Ken Wilber) and is also recognized in empirical work.

The publication is "A new tool to map the major worldviews in the Netherlands and USA, and explore how they relate to climate change" (2016) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901116301794](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901116301794 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901116301794") co-authored with Nic Hedlund
