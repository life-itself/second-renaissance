> Our mission is to grow the resilience of individuals and communities to the impacts of climate change, so that we can enhance our agency despite climate instability, and are equipped to respond to the crisis through transformation and regeneration.
> 
> We support innovative cultural, scientific, educational, and community-led projects, that are transdiciplinary and foster belonging, so as to develop and share knowledge, tools and methods for resilience-building. We partner with cultural organizations, scientific institutions, international organizations, local civil-society organizations, and others. We enjoy co-designing projects with partners who are open to growing their inner resilience as they engage into the regeneration of communities and/or ecosystems through context-specific initiatives. We mobilize traditional ecological knowledge and modern science, work across disciplines and generations, integrate new technologies when impactful, and value art as a channel for transformation. Last, we build communities of support to grow our inner resilience together.
> 
> Our four main areas of work focus on: new questions & inspiration through Tero magazine; local action & global connection through the Tapestry programme for resilient local communities; open dialogues, responsible experimentation & life-long learning through our Resilience Nests; and collaboration for cultural & organizational transformation through our Waves of change programme.
