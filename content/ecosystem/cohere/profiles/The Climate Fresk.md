>The Climate Fresk NGO was created in December 2018 by **Cédric Ringenbach** in order to accelerate the spread of the tool, to train and upskill Climate Fresk facilitators who are the international community of Freskers.
>
>It is based on a decentralised and participative approach, based on the principles of do-docracy, the right to make mistakes, the rule of three, transparency and the duplication of initiatives.

>OUR PURPOSE: To accelerate the understanding of climate issues at the global level in order to help trigger the necessary changes for the preservation of life as soon as possible.
>
>Climate Fresk encourages the rapid and widespread spread of an understanding of climate issues. 

> OUR VISION: Climate change is a complex problem that affects us all, but it is still very badly understood by the general population.
>
>We don’t have much time, but by understanding the challenge we can take our response to the next level.
>
>Climate Fresk prompts participants to take constructive action to help tackle climate change.
>
>Our ambition is to create a network of people that is growing exponentially who can pass on this quality climate education in order to reach a social tipping point that will help guide us to a low carbon world.

## Theory of Change

- One of the things that is often emphasized on their website is 'scale'; namely, that their services can be applied to individuals, and to small or large organizations. 
- Their approach is one where informing people and organisations about the climate crisis leads to more informed individuals and to better and more sustainable practices. 
- "The Climate Fresk methodology doesn’t involve an expert presenting information to the group; instead, it requires all participants to take an active role in the building-up of the Fresk, becoming participative learners."

## Key Learning Resources

They use the IPCC reports on climate change to guide their teaching: https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/
