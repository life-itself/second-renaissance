> ConsciousCafe was founded in 2011 when a group of friends got together to hold deep, conscious conversations.
> 
> It is now a global organisation with a network of established local groups and new ones opening throughout the year, across the world. Our events enable attendees to experience conscious connections with new people, make friends and grow in knowledge and understanding while social media brings like-minded individuals together across the world to share their thoughts and ideas.
