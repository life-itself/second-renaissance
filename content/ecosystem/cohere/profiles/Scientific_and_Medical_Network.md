> "For fifty years, the Scientific and Medical Network has been bringing together individuals – including professionals with a background in science, medicine, engineering, psychology, philosophy and complementary practices – who accept the existence of a fundamental, unifying and transcendent reality.
> 
> Given the current divisive and disconnected state of the world, we maintain that there is a pressing need for a worldview that goes beyond the prevailing materialist ethos and provides the rising generation with an orienting sense of meaning and purpose.
> 
> We thus feel it more important than ever to affirm our original transformative aim of promoting humanity’s spiritual essence as compatible with enlightened scientific thinking.
> 
> Through our extensive educational programme, featuring internationally renowned speakers and visionaries in their respective fields, we provide a creative forum for exploring frontier issues at the interfaces between science, spirituality, consciousness and well-being.
> 
> In a spirit of open and critical enquiry, we seek to integrate ‘heart’ and ‘head’ – connecting intuitive insights with evidence-based reason."
