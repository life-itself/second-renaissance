> Started in 1978 with a small group, we’re currently a community of around 160, working towards autonomous decentralized models for a post-capitalist world, with those who share our vision of Terra Nova.
> 
> We believe in a future without war, in love without fear, and work to build Terra Nova by creating Healing Biotopes as centers to research and model a new planetary culture, with strong ethical foundations.
