>The German speaking Center for Human Emergence (CHE) focuses on developing evolutionary future competences and innovative models of thinking and awareness, on researching and training. We are convinced that we will need new approaches to master the historical transition from modern and postmodern society to the integral age to create sustainable answers for the future of our cultures and communities.
>
>Thus, the German CHE aligns itself with the work of the CHEs Worldwide, a network organization founded by [Dr. Don Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck) . They all focus on social and cultural transitions and the facilitation of healthy and sustainable living spaces.  In their respective regions on the planet, they create momentum of change.

The intention of CHE is to

>explore and design freshest models for human coexistence and collaboration. We conceive coexistence as a process that can be enriched and shaped by evolutionary impulses. In doing so, we focus on the creation, development and implementation of integral models of social architecture that foster the transition from the modern and postmodern era to the integral age.
>
>With our actions, we promote the evolution of consciousness in the global context of one of the major transformation process, which humanity has passed through on its evolutionary journey so far, we address the following issues:
>
>- Support the transition
>- Navigate easily and efficiently complexity and diversity
>- Empower the individual as a co-designer of the future
>- Promote social innovation in organizations
>- Develop evolutionary co-leadership
