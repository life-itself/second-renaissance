 >The Gaia Foundation is a small, international organisation with 35 years’ experience accompanying partners, communities and movements around the world to revive and protect bio-cultural diversity. We take a holistic approach to regenerate healthy ecosystems and strengthen community self-governance. Both are critical as we face the grave reality of climate chaos, biodiversity collapse and social injustice.
>
>Together with our partners from the Atlantic to the Arctic, Africa to the Amazon, we are reweaving the basket of life, revalorising the knowledge systems that enhance it, and restoring a respectful relationship with the Earth.

>We are committed to...
>
>- Reviving and protecting cultural and biological diversity in order to restore resilience for ecosystems and local communities, across connected landscapes.
>- Enhancing traditional knowledge and practices for land, seed, food and water sovereignty, thereby enabling communities to determine their own locally and culturally appropriate pathways rooted in regenerative principles and practices.
>- Linking with social movements who together can challenge the industrial growth economy and promote pathways for systemic transformation.
>- Speaking out for ‘Gaia’ – Mother Earth – and the rights of future generations of all species, yet to inhabit this planet.
>- Restoring a respectful relationship with, and a holistic understanding of, our one planet Earth.
>- Celebrating and re-weaving the web of Life, which sustains us all.
