>A sense of division and powerlessness, and alienation run as deep undercurrents in today’s society at local, national, and global levels. These are often rooted in centuries-old injustices, unresolved traumas, and hierarchical worldviews that continue to fester and leave us often feeling helpless, afraid, and overwhelmed.
>
>Yet, there is in all of us a fundamental knowing and desire for balance, social connection, and belonging to others and life itself. Relationships between humans and the natural world are often a big source of nourishment.
>
>Our vision is to embark on a journey of discovery and inquiry to understand these undercurrents better, listen to what they allude to, and explore what it takes to shift and translate them toward meaningful actions.
>
>Together, across places, sectors, and social classes, we will encounter unknowns, challenges, and new opportunities. The journey will encourage us to rethink our most basic assumptions and invite us to embody reality in new ways that regenerate and enhance life, maybe more radical than we can imagine now.
>
>On the journey, we will explore concrete solutions and actions for diverse sectors, areas, and aspects of our global and interconnected world, inspired by this emerging culture of care that includes all beings.
>
>The WorldEthicForum aims to co-creating the preconditions for building and maintaining a culture of care and partnership and to nurture individual and collective capacities to help shift deeply ingrained patterns.
>
>The WorldEthicForum wants to build on this foundation to move toward a society characterized by a radically shared aliveness.

## Theory of Change

>We acknowledge that we live in a time of global polycrisis, a time of high urgency and necessity for transformational changes, where speed could be the answer. Nevertheless, our suggestion is to slow down, valuing the listening, repatterning, and learning from each other’s experiences and perspectives, and dedicating a seven-year arc to this inquiry and exploration.
>
>We have seen that many attempts to shift the tides have not yet added up or landed substantially over the past decades.
>
>We wonder if it may be in the deeper layers of our culture that there lay some answers and findings for how to restore and rewire our social fabrics towards fostering intentional and awareness-based aptitudes, practices, and individual and collective capacities and to strengthen them over time.
