> Our vision is to empower future-oriented people to lead collectively towards a sustainable future.

> Sustainability is a truly global issue. How well we meet that challenge, success and failure in moving towards a more sustainable way of living, affects everybody. We believe in the principle of cooperation and collectively created solutions – across sectors, institutions, nations, and cultures.

We empower leaders who anchor their action in the concern for the greater good and the future of humankind on this planet – for responsible business, people-oriented public service, and a strong civil society.
> 
> We build a global community for change by activating networks and fostering mutual support among change agents.
