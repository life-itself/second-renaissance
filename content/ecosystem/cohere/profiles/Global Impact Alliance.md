>The current focus is on fixing individual issues such as poverty, gender inequality, climate change, etc. All important problems - however, we believe that they will not be truly solved without a deep paradigm and culture shift within each of us ("inner transformation") and conscious action and collaboration for impact and redesign of our systems ("systemic change")  - as it takes both, inner work as well as a critical mass of people coming together to challenge our current system design and implement alternatives that from their core foster the wellbeing of people and planet.

They are fostering a community of "conscious citizens" and "conscious organisations" who are "on the path of embodying wisdom & conscious action".

They host salons and gatherings and are developing some courses.

Their target audience seems to be mainly business leaders and investors.
