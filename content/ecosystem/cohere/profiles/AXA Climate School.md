>We provide resources to educate and inform organisations about environmental sustainability.

>**A new approach to sustainable transition training**

>In 2021, we realized that there was a lack of tools to broadly engage employees on environmental issues in companies and public institutions. To remedy this issue, we launched the Climate School, which aims to explain the impacts of sustainable transformation for companies, businesses and employees alike.
>
>Since then, we have created new formats to meet the needs of our clients seeking more sector-specific knowledge or to engage their employees with more varied content. Today, we enable HR Departments to support the skills development of their employees worldwide, and ESG Managers to involve all their staff in their sustainable transition approach.
