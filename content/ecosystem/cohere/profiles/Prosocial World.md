>Through a process of humble inquiry and practical application of both inner and outer work, ProSocial helps foster collaboration within and between groups at multiple scales – emulating the cooperation of a multicellular super-organism.

>Our science-based approach integrates previously isolated academic disciplines and can be applied to all topic areas (e.g., health, education, business, sustainability, spirituality...) and all scales from small groups to large networks and organizations, to the whole planet.
