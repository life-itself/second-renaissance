> "Living Cities Earth is a global bottom-up movement based on integral approach and dedicated to creating conditions for people in 10.000 cities worldwide to live healthier happier lives in harmony with each other and with nature.
> 
> The power of LCE lies in people and communication, wisdom and practical knowledge, partnerships and cooperation — and in our ability to create impact by combining all these.
> 
> We aim at growing a global impact-community of 1 million change leaders from 10.000 cities who in turn influence lives of 8 billion people as well as all life on Earth." 
> 
> "As humans, we are intricately connected to the evolutionary web of life. In our modern, complex world what does it mean to “human well''? Living Cities Earth is an interdisciplinary action research network, connecting 10,000 cities and a web of integral experts serving Gaia’s well-being.
> 
> To “human well” we nurture our cities and ecoregions as healthy, happy, caring homes in harmony with each other and nature, across four key dimensions: person, people, places, and planet. Our cities and bioregions survive and thrive honouring all life on our ONE planet."
