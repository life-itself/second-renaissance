>Seeds is a currency that aligns money with value. We value people, planet and prosperity for all.

>We came together to co-create a new economic system. SEEDS offers tools to help you, your business and your movement regenerate our planet and encourage collaboration, cooperation and community building. We are changing the way we assign and distribute value.

>Instead of being more profitable to exploit the natural world, we reward the regeneration of our planet.
>
>Using algorithms within the SEEDS platforms, we incentivise collaborative and regenerative behaviours and activities for the wellbeing of the whole.
