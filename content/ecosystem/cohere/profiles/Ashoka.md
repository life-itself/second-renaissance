"Ashoka builds and cultivates a community of Fellows, Young Changemakers, Changemaker Institutions, and beyond who see that the world now requires everyone to be a **_changemaker_** – a person that sees themselves as capable of creating large-scale, positive change.  
 
Together, amidst the exponential growth of a new inequality in changemaking at a worldwide scale, we mobilize (and accelerate) a movement to build an "Everyone a Changemaker" world where **_all_** people have the right and ability to co-lead solutions that transform their societies for the better."
