> "One Humanity Institute is a social incubator. A global nexus where one can experience both the micro and macro potential of a united humanity.
> 
> The One Humanity Institute (OHI) is a global institute without walls represented with a Center located in Oświęcim, Poland, next to Auschwitz. Acting as an intergenerational hub, OHI Bakery is the launching point and prototype for the larger campus. It will serve as a co-working space, global meeting hub, and peace library alongside a revitalized bakery. It will again serve the community, its local youth, and visitors from around the world. It will become  a living laboratory for solutions for peaceful co-existence for a more compassionate, equitable and just world."
