> The Spanish Society of General Systems is a non-profit society that was founded in 1980 to be a national benchmark for Systemics and a meeting point for the different sectors of society (Social, Political, Economic, Military, Educational, etc. .), to address the problems of the 21st century, through the design and application of new models.
> 
> Current human conflicts require a new paradigm for their solution. The outdated concepts of the 20th century and previous centuries are no longer valid. The design and implementation of new models for the 21st century is urgent, required by the end of the cycle that we must address.
> 
> Systemic Thinking based on General Systems Theory and the analysis of Complex Systems is our response for the elaboration of Models that are needed to govern this change.
> 
> Since its foundation, the Spanish Society of General Systems has been a forum and tribune for Spanish systemists within the Spanish University. SESGE wants to add to its objectives the incorporation of students and scholars who wish to participate in the practical application of systemic thinking to social, economic and business problems that we must address without delay.
