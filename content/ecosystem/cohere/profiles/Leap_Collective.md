> "We are activists, social entrepreneurs, foundation staff, and philanthropists working towards systemic change in philanthropy.
> 
> Our goal is to contribute to a philanthropic sector that shares power, to support systems transformation in a radically transparent way. Experiments are Leap’s method of disruption and creation in philanthropy. We seek out important projects that need, but do not receive, funding, and help connect them with resources, people and institutions."
