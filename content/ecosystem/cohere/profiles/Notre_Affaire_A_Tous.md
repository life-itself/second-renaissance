> "Notre Affaire à Tous is a non-profit organisation which uses law as a strategic lever in the fight against the triple environmental crisis – climate, biodiversity, pollution. It defends a vision of law in favour of social justice and the primary affected communities.
> 
> Notre Affaire à Tous was created to work towards the establishment of climate justice through legal tools. The majority of the organisation's members are lawyers. Most are also young women engaged in this essential fight for climate and social justice and bring a united voice to change the world.
> 
> Our challenge for this century is to envisage, invent and build an economic, societal and governance model that respects and protects life on Earth, in order to preserve human dignity and the planet on which we live."
