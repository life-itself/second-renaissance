>Our purpose is better wellbeing for people in the UK and Ireland. Our experience tells us that we can have the biggest impact on people’s lives when we influence decision-makers, whether these are businesses, politicians, civil or public services, or nongovernmental organisations.
>
>We work with partners to contribute to what is known about wellbeing, testing and studying what works in practice. We then use evidence to make the case for which approaches and systems need to change, and recommend how to make that happen.

>Today Carnegie UK aims to improve collective wellbeing by influencing public policy and practice. 
>
>We do this by conducting research and writing reports. But we’re also working to amplify the voices of a wide range of individuals and communities, drawing on their experience to make the case for change to politicians, civil servants and other decision-makers.
