> "Nothing is intractable because . . .
> Human systems dynamics (HSD) creates opportunities out of chaos. Our methods give you power to see patterns in complexity. You will understand your most wicked problems in new and useful ways. Most important, you will take innovative action to move past biggest challenges and toward future success.
> 
> We build capacity among individuals, teams, communities to deal with the complexity of day-to-day existence. In public and private Adaptive Action Labs, we guide clients through innovative design, implementation, and assessment cycles to find breakthrough responses to intractable issues. In research and writing we create and disseminate perspectives, models, and methods for thriving in the 21st century."
