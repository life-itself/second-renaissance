- The Universe Loves a Happy Ending by Hans Andeweg (book) -- "The Universe Loves a Happy Ending is a new work from Hans Andeweg, the author of In Resonance with Nature. The earlier book became the basis of an instrument-based eco-healing method. This book describes a revolutionary paradigm for energetic healing called ECOIntention, a technologyfree way of healing life- and ecosystems from a distance."
