>We need to start inside to sustainably change the outside. This is why we established a powerful self transformation program based on neuroscience, meditation, yoga and psychology. It has the potential to deeply transform the underlyingcauses of the climate crisis which are found in the minds of individuals. It also has helped thousands of young people to overcome life threatening eating disorders, traumas from sexual abuse and violence, suicidal tendencies and so many more!

>The Mindfulness Project System has been scientifically researched by the University of Murcia, Spain and has shown amazing results!
>
>We are a German Non-profit organization with a spiritual foundation, dedicated to planting 100% of our donations straight into the ground. While the Mindfulness Project is already planting seeds of change in the minds of volunteers and community members alike, we aim to grow this impact exponentially.

They have 3 main activities:

- Nature restoration (reforestation in Thailand)
- Sustainable community centre (in Thailand)
- Programmes for self-development (based on neuroscience, meditation, yoga and psychology)
