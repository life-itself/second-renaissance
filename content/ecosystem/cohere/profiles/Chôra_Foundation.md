> Creating an open and dynamic multi-sided platform, a Space called CHÔRA. At its core, this space has a Strategic Design capability that seeds and structures Portfolios of Innovation Options. In these portfolios learning activities and sensemaking protocols generate intelligence that feeds into strategic arguments. These arguments support innovation and transformational intents and the design of execution pathways."
