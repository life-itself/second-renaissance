> "Ananda Kalyani is a pioneering Integrated Rural Development (IRD) project of Ananda Marga dedicated to spirituality, local development and holistic regeneration, encompassing environmental, economic, and social aspects. Our aim is to serve as a model and educational hub for sustainable and regenerative living in the 21st century.
> 
> Nestled in the heart of Portugal, near the Serra da Estrela Natural Reserve, Ananda Kalyani has been transformed from a lush, abandoned valley into a vibrant, habitable space over the past few years. [...]
> 
> Our property spans 50 hectares, featuring wild forests, a picturesque river, scattered ruins, small springs, and wild fruit trees, and 11 hectares of certified organic agricultural land. [...]
> 
> In 2010, we set out to find land in Serra da Estrela to build and establish an Ananda Marga Master Unit in Portugal. The dream was to create a model integrated development project and blissful community for collective spiritual practice, self-realization and service to all beings. That dream is what we now call Ananda Kalyani. Our community has grown over the past 12 years from a small group of visionaries and an overgrown and desolate land into a recognized Master Unit, GEN European ecovillage and ERASMUS+ Partner. We host youth exchanges, training courses, events, workshops, and retreats, and have formed lasting connections with a global Ananda Kalyani family."
