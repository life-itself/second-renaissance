>A Synergy Circle focused on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was initiated by members of the [Evolutionary Leaders (EL) Circle](http://www.evolutionaryleaders.net/), a project of the [Source of Synergy Foundation](http://www.sourceofsynergyfoundation.org/). 

> Mission: The SDG Synergy Circle is committed to articulating and widely disseminating a consciousness based on evolutionary principles to those who are actively engaged in the SDG effort (termed “evolutionary”). These assumptions represent a contemporary shift in leadership consciousness which can potentially propel a broader shift in consciousness among those engaged in SDG efforts, and eventually more broadly in the populace.

## Theory of Change 

>The primary view shared by the SDG synergy group members is based on three interlocking assumptions:  
 >
>- Environmental care, equitable sharing of Earth’s regenerative resources, peace, and mutual care represent vital areas that are in need of critical attention globally if human civilization is to survive and thrive.
>- Progress toward achieving these goals has been inadequate given the urgency of the issues and the demonstrated impacts of the effects of unaddressed problems.
>- The framing of the SDGs reflects mechanistic assumptions and consequential strategies that are not likely to lead to the level of progress that is critically needed. These assumptions need to shift to a unitive new narrative and unitary consciousness (called “evolutionary”) that recognizes the nature and interdependence of life and the finite boundaries of the living Earth if the level of genuine transformation that is needed is to be achieved.
