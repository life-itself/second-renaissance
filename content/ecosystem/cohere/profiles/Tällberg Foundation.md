>The **Tällberg Foundation, launched in 1981** by Swedish business leader Bo Ekman, explores the issues that are challenging and changing our societies, with the goal of stimulating new thinking and discovering new solutions. The world that we have known since the mid 20th century, which produced unprecedented peace as well as unparalleled human advance, is changing at a pace and in directions that threaten to devolve towards Orwellian dystopia. All is made worse by the accelerating retreat from globalism, even in the face of problems whose very nature demands **global solutions**.

>But globalization is not dead and forces for “good” still exist; they need to be renewed, made more muscular and more effective. The Foundation aspires to be part of that process.
>
>Tällberg’s work program focuses on understanding how to re-inject ethics into leadership; re-establish the legitimacy of governance; and manage, instead of being managed by, disruptive technologies, climate change, mass migration and other phenomena. We seek **new thinking for a new world**.
