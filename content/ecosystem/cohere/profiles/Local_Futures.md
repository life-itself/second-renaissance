> 
> Founder and director Helena Norberg-Hodge is a widely-respected analyst of the global economy’s impacts on communities, local economies, and personal identity around the world.
> 
> What we do
> - Share the big picture: We illuminate and explore the systemic root causes of our current global crises with our books, films, campaigns, ‘education for action’ tools, and worldwide activist-oriented events.
> - Unite and connect: We focus on root causes, not symptoms, to create common ground among activists, small farmers, indigenous communities, main street business owners—and everyone else.
> - Show a path forward: We promote economic localization—shifting our economies towards place-based, human-scale activity—as a strategy for change that simultaneously addresses our many crises.
