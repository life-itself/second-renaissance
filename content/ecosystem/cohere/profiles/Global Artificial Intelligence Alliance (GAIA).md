>The **Global Artificial Intelligence Alliance** (GAIA) is a multidisciplinary **impact start-up** which uses **collective creativity** to develop **artificial intelligence with compassion**. Our team of scientists, entrepreneurs, activists and philosophers globally research AI’s social, sociological, legal, technological and ethical aspects of AI. **Collective wisdom** has undeniably been deeply ingrained in GAIA’s DNA from the very beginning.
>
>Our goal is to identify and analyze the ethical challenges and opportunities of AI, including the development of empathetic AI algorithms. We investigate a range of ethical issues related to AI, such as privacy concerns and bias in decision-making. Lack of accountability for actions taken by artificial intelligence and the long-term impact on society are also studied. What’s more, in GAIA we look into the potential for AI to be used in ways that violate ethical principles.
