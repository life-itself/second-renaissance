A Mighty Network community.
 
> People all over the world are gathering to regenerate the Earth at the bioregional scale and organize into a planetary network of learning exchanges between landscapes. All of this is being done in service to the regeneration of the entire Planet.
> 
> When Joe Brewer wrote his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, it was to show both the seriousness of the predicament we are in and to demonstrate that it really is possible to regenerate the Earth at the scales needed. The pathway he describes in the book is to organize ourselves around holistic, integrated landscapes known as bioregions, and connect those bioregions into a planetary network of learning exchanges.
> 
> Members of the Design School are working together on the ground in bioregions while simultaneously building a planetary network and community engaging in this kind of bioregional work. All of this enables focused actions to arise with clear design and intent so that we can effectively regenerate at the bioregional scale and create interactions and supports between and across bioregions.
> 
> The challenges humanity and the Earth are facing now are extremely complex and unlike anything that has come before in the history of the planet. In order to regenerate the Earth at the scales needed, we must consciously and intentionally evolve humanity into a "planetary species" and cooperate at unprecedented levels. Members of the Design School are choosing to step fully into this challenge and do what we can to embody and live out the design pathway for regenerating Earth.
