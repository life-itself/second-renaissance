> Dark Matter Labs (Dm) is working on what is needed to manifest transformations to our food, housing, land, material and nature systems towards a future of mutual thriving.  
> 
> In doing this, we analyse the shifts it requires in the underlying ‘dark matter’ - monetary, economic, governance, regulatory and policy systems - to make this possible, and we work with partners to demonstrate these alternatives in neighbourhoods, cities and bioregions. We share these insights openly for mutual learning. (https://darkmatterlabs.org/)

> We’re establishing toolkits and blueprints, pilots, and case studies, supporting communities and institutions with applications, digital products and civic technologies that challenge established thought and demonstrate that an alternative is possible. (https://darkmatterlabs.org/About)

## Key People

## Theory of Change
  
> We’re working to initiate a _[boring revolution](https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956)_[︎](https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956) that will propel wider societal transition. We began as a five-person experiment in London and we've become a global, multi-disciplinary, 60-person team with specialisms ranging across financing and lawmaking to economic art and data science.  
> 
> We don’t profess to know all the answers, but we’re continuing to ask the questions. We’re looking to work openly and collaboratively, sharing any findings and discoveries, developing a learning community and encouraging likeminded collaborators to pick up the work and apply it within their own contexts and geographies.
