>**UNESCO Collective Healing Initiative** aims at healing and addressing the wounds and psycho-social, economic and political consequences of the transatlantic trade of enslaved peoples and slavery. The hope is to create pathways towards personal, cultural, relational and institutional transformation, and enable human well-being in harmony with the flourishing of other beings, and the ecological integrity of our planet.
