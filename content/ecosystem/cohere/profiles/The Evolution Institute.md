## Key People

- David Sloan Wilson, Co-Founder & Member of Board of Directors

## Theory of Change

- "Our vision is to apply research, knowledge and expertise in order to elevate quality of life, advance social justice and human equality, and add value to issues affecting humanity for the benefit all people."
- "The Evolution Institute’s premise is that elevating quality of life requires a largely bottom-up approach and a high-quality education that advances universal cooperation and critical thinking. We find this premise applicable to the European Union and the US, whose members generally have a high quality of life and substantial resources that enable them to cooperate most of the time quite well."
