>Amt Für Zukunft is a think and do tank for a future-proof society.

>Amt Für Zukunft exists to open up the space of possibilities and to find desirable futures within it, which we want to manifest.
>
>It is important to us to cultivate an optimism that is aware of the challenges and thus to develop alternatives to the status quo. We collaborate with a wide range of projects and organizations and offer our commitment to a sustainable society as a service provider.

>Amt Für Zukunft supports development processes for organizations and groups. We help to better understand the possibilities of the future and to activate one's own creative power through vision, strategic orientation or new offers. Together we organize tailor-made paths into the future. To do this, we orchestrate the appropriate methods to create an effective process.
