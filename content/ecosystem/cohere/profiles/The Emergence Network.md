>We are a fugitive, underground network of social artists seeking to create new openings to age-old problems. We aim to disrupt dominant modes of perception, engagement, and responsiveness in a time of crisis by disturbing modern notions of justice, power, and human agency. 
>
>This is the work of **postactivism**, a concept developed by ten’s visionary founder, Báyò Akómoláfé. We do this work by instigating **collaborative, creative processes** in **translocal interventions** as a cultural practice. 
>
 >Our shared vision is of a political emancipatory project of interdependent networks and ecologies of practice interested in shifting our ontological gaze beyond the staid confines and moral purview of justice, diversity, representation and inclusion. By engaging in deep inquiry, conversations, and experimental processes, we aim to nurture an underground movement at the end of hope.
