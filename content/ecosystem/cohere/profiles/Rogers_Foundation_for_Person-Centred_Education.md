> Based on Carl R. Rogers’s thoughts, we believe that a person can understand and fulfil him or herself through live, personal experiences and in relationships of positive regard and real acceptance.
> 
> Our mission is to make people conscious about the importance of acceptance by experiencing it, and to provide places for real encounters, overcoming all obstacles.
> 
> For this purpose, we organize and run educational, experiential activities, and research and development services.
