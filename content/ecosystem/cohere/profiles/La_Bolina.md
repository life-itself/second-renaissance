> La Bolina is an ecological, regenerative and intercultural association based in El Valle, near Granada, Spain.
> 
> "We’ve decided to start our vision right here where we live – El Valle; a municipality of three depopulating rural villages, between Granada and the coast. 
> 
> The La Bolina team moved to El Valle in December 2017 motivated by co-creating a project, and way of life, that balanced regeneration, integration and sustainability. 
> 
> We believe that through living locally and catalysing regenerative initiatives with others (in El Valle and further afield) we can together bring about sustained positive social and environmental change.
> 
> We are dedicated to the dignified and respectful integration of migrants and refugees , we run education and training programmes, we grow ecological veg to sell in veg boxes and to restaurants and eco shops bringing new circular economy to El Valle. 
> 
> Since arriving we have been joined by new project members, migrants and refugees, producers, students, collaborators and volunteers who have supported this young project to take root.
> 
> La Bolina is becoming integrated locally and regionally and our team members are becoming an active part of village life. This means that through connecting with local people we are actively listening to what is needed and learning from local traditions – whilst also bringing a global perspective on complexity, migration and the need for regenerative agriculture and localised food systems.
> 
> La Bolina’s projects and actions adapt (like a living ecosystem) responding to changes in the local context – such as connections with people, new collaborators, local politics, the trends in migration and the realities of the Spanish asylum system, availability of land and learning new farming techniques."
