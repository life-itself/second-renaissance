## Theory of Change 

New Paradigm Research is a transdisciplinary inquiry into humanly and socially relevant ideas and conceptions emerging above all in the sciences, but also in social media and other areas of contemporary culture. The purpose of the research is to articulate a coherent, meaningful view of the human being and his or her world, based on cutting-edge scientific research. The importance of this endeavor lies in providing an accurate and comprehensible picture of where we are today, and where we could be heading tomorrow.
