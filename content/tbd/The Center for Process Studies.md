# About 

**The Center for Process Studies** (CPS) is a nonprofit think-tank that conducts research and develops educational resources on holistic thinking that advances social, spiritual, and environmental wellbeing. Influenced by the process-relational philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947), CPS works across traditional disciplinary boundaries to conduct rigorous research on fundamental topics such as, what the world is like, what it means to be human, and how humans should live. This work is guided by an ecological worldview that considers interdependence, change, and intrinsic value to be core features of reality.
