>The World Happiness Foundation’s purpose is to realize such a world with freedom, consciousness, and happiness, FOR ALL. Humanity has never faced simultaneously such vulnerability and opportunity to make this come true. We are not asking in vain how can we realize a world where everyone is free, healthy, and happy. On the contrary, The World Happiness Foundation is actively working on finding the answer to this most important question. Thankfully, the number of creative thinkers, social impact organizations, and practitioners who understand that this is not a zero-sum game is growing. And we are here to unite and amplify those leaders, institutions, and programs that are making the world a happier place.

## Key People

## Theory of Change

They propose a concept of "Happytalism":

>Happytalism proposes eudaimonia as a guiding idea and the use of technology which can only improve the quality of the human condition. Since technology has both positive and negative effects on human happiness, we have to use it only as a means to move forward, not as a tool for comparison or a weapon. With a proper and systematic approach to technology, we can use it to understand life better and improve the human condition altogether. This is the core message of Happytalism - that by reaching higher states of awareness, consciousness, and mindfulness, we can establish communities with beliefs, rules, and culture built on love, compassion, and empathy. Through positive education, we can help others find their purpose, help them understand what matters to them individually, and eventually integrate their individual interests and needs with those of the community as a whole.

They also work with a concept they call 'bē':

>Underpinning everything we do is something we call, bé. bé represents what we consider to be the “life force energy” that acts as the guiding compass of The Foundation. By life force energy we mean vitality. We draw this concept from similar beliefs found in Eastern traditions, for example, Qi in Ancient Chinese Medicine, or Prana, in the Hindu yogic traditions. We believe that this vibrant “energy” is incredibly important to our existence as a Foundation because it acts as a through-line, holding all aspects of what we accomplish together under one lively spirit. It allows us to observe the changes we make over time and aligns us with our values.
