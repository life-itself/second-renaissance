# About 

According to their website, "We’re a global team of adaptive innovators, creative problem solvers, and facilitators of societal transformation, striving to make the world more peaceful, just, and sustainable through enhanced multi-stakeholder collaboration". Some of their projects range from 'transforming food systems in Brazil' to 'urban water resilience in Africa'.

They are involved with 'systems change projects' at a number of different levels, and take a consulting role in order to provide solutions. They are involved in a number of different 'sectors', and have practical experience in what systems change looks like at different levels and how it occurs (or doesn't occur).


They have a branch called 'social labs' which aims to "bring together people from across the system to seek the root causes behind their problems and then collaborate on devising and testing solutions aimed at key leverage points. This change work continues in the “lab” of the real world – over time and in context."

## Theory of Change 

Reos Partners makes 'systems change' central to their strategy and efforts, and they aim to do it in a few different ways. First, on large and small scales; they believe systems change requires efforts on both levels, and take on projects which are country wide as well as more local ones. Next, they believe that transforming existing structures, as well as building new structures is an important focus of systems change. Their 'solutions' try to find a balance between these two dimensions.

As mentioned in the 'social labs' information, they believe in the notion of 'leverage points' as being key to addressing systems change.
