# About 

Catalist is a website that is particularly project driven, and allows people and organizations to get more easily involved in. In this sense, it is more 
action oriented than meta resource. In a way, they are also interested in 'cohering' the field of change agents. 

It is organized into different 'spaces', 'objects' 'sets' and 'attributes'. At times, it can feel a little unclear why this exact organization is chosen, and whether it really works for organizing the different 'change agents' and material out there. Perhaps it can be a useful method; although at this point it seems a little confusing. 'Objects', for example, are anything that is created on catalist, although theya re categorized by 'type'- why not attribute? 

Nonetheless it includes a lot of useful information and frameworks (sets)

## Theory of Change 

Catlist puts it the following way on their website: 

The Problem: Technology isn't designed to maximize collective intelligence, collaboration, and coordinated action towards what matters most.  

The Solution: Creating a value-driven ecosystem of tools designed to educate and unite the change-makers of the world, liberate us from our screens, and empower the action needed to preserve life on planet earth. 

Catlist points out that 'we must change every aspect of society: our economic, social and technical systems.' 

The following quote from Buckminster Fuller appears on their website: 

_“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”_― Buckminster Fuller
