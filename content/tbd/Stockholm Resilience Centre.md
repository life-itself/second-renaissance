>Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) is an international research centre on resilience and sustainability science
>
>Since its launch in 2007, SRC has developed into a world-leading science centre for addressing the complex challenges facing humanity.
>
>The centre is a joint initiative between Stockholm University and the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics at The Royal Swedish Academy Sciences. [...]
>
>We believe in the importance of [reconnecting to the biosphere](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2015-02-19-reconnect-to-the-biosphere.html). We must stop considering nature as something separate from society because people and nature are truly intertwined in what we refer to as social-ecological systems. Development can no longer be done without an increased understanding of nature’s role for our own survival and well-being.

>The mission of the centre is to advance research for governance and management of social-ecological systems to secure ecosystem services for human well-being and resilience for long-term sustainability
