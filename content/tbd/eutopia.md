# About 

Eutopia is an alliance of 10 European universities. Together, they are a network which aims to increase collaboration across different geographies, work together on wicked problems, and transform the university system. 

According to their website "we live in a time of pressing planetary and democratic challenges that require massive and novel coordinated scientific and societal efforts on an unprecedented scale. EUTOPIA European University takes the opportunity and 
responsibility to assume a leading role in an era when the destiny of the planet is preci­sely in the hands of human beings." 

EUTOPIA engages in this role at both regional and international level and the members of the alliance take the responsibility to respect, protect and realize these values in the building of the European University, with the surrounding territory and at a global scale. In coherence with the European values of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the following set of values-principles is meant to become part of the alliance’s common culture and points of reference 
for the joint activities, the co-construction processes and all our deliverables, as well as our outreach to the entire society.

## Theory of Change 

Eutopia aims to increase collaboration with other universities in Europe so as to collaborate on particular problems- like, for example, climate change. If anything has become abundantly clear in the past few years, it is that certain challenges, like climate change, cannot be approached  in silos, but instead requires careful and meaningful coordination.

## Connections 

Eutopia could actually serve as a very unique and meaningful change agent, Not only because of the size of the network and the power of the network, but if one takes the Overton  window as an example of acceptable approaches to cultural evolution, they are an example of mainstream institutions who are interested in systems change. The rector of VUB, recently called for a 'second renaissance' in education, and Life Itself also uses this term to consider our current moment.
