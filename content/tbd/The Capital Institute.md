# About 

The capital institute is a small team of economists interested in transforming the current 'economic system.' Since they have quite a small team, they don't have that many projects, although they do release a lot of meaningful information on economic systems change, and appear to have a lot of expertise in this area. They don't just want to transform the 'economic system' to be more efficient in resource distribution; they also view this as fundamental to improving peoples lives. 

Nonetheless they have built a sizable network, and as they put it on their website,'' with our global ecosystem of 1000+ change makers, we combine modern science, storytelling, and the knowledge of timeless wisdom traditions to illuminate the path from an extractive economy to an emerging regenerative economy that supports the long-term well-being of people, planet and business.""

## Theory of Change 

Today’s greatest challenge is to address the root cause of our systemic crises – today’s dominant (neoliberal) economic paradigm and the financial system that fuels it and rules it – by transitioning to a more effective economic system design that is regenerative and therefore sustainable over the long term.

The universal patterns and principles nature uses to build stable, healthy, and sustainable systems throughout the real world can and must be used as a model for a new design of our economic system and the financial system that fuels it.
