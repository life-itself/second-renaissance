### Key people 



## Theory of Change 

Reos Partners makes 'systems change' central to their strategy and efforts, and they aim to do it in a few different ways.

Next, they believe that transforming existing structures, as well as building new structures is an important focus of systems change. Their 'solutions' try to find a balance between these two dimensions.
