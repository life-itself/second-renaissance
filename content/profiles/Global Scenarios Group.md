# About 

The GSG is a group of researchers dedicated to outlining different 'possible futures', and getting a sense for which future we are going towards.

## Theory of Change 

As outlined in the picture above, they imagine 6 different possible futures, each with their own kind of culture and way of being. 'Conventional worlds' outline a world which emerges out of some of the standard 'change' messages we hear about today, and great transitions outline a world which goes beyond these conventional kinds of transformation. 

They have a lot of data on possible worlds: this one diagram below shows how the data is visualized, and what different kinds of data points mean in different worlds. Here is one example of what it looks like, for 'water use per capita' in 'western europe.' They are also closely connected to the Tellus Institute.
