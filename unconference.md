### To Explore the Metacrisis & the Second Renaissance

The metacrisis is a symptom of something deeper—a world in transition. The Second Renaissance is about what comes next: new ways of knowing, new ways of organizing, new ways of being. This is an **in-person gathering** bringing together key voices from the metacrisis, second renaissance, metamodern, and liminal communities to **meet, connect, and create together.** It is part of the larger **Human Transformation in a time of Metacrisis** event, a two-day convening exploring education and transformation in the face of the metacrisis.

- 📍 **Location**: Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA
- 🗓 **Dates**: May 2nd–3rd, 2025
- 🎟 **Cost**: $79 earlybird covering both unconference and formal conference days. (And if the cost is an obstacle to attending there are reduced tickets available)

## Why This? Why Now?

Many of us have been building ideas, projects, and networks online for years. But there is no substitute for gathering in person. This is a chance to:

- **Strengthen our networks**—meet the people shaping this space.
- **Bring new people in**—connect with students, thinkers, and builders from inside and outside Harvard.
- **Create real collaborations**—turn ideas into action.
- **Expand the visibility of these ideas**—by hosting this at Harvard, we bridge the gap between emergent movements and existing institutions.

## What’s Happening?

This gathering is part of the larger **Human Transformation in a time of Metacrisis** event, a two-day convening exploring education, transformation, and systems change in the face of the metacrisis.

- **Friday, May 2nd**: formal conference with features structured sessions including speakers like **Zak Stein**, **Rebecca Henderson**, **Jon Kabat-Zinn** and others.
- **Saturday, May 3rd**: A full-day **unconference**—a dynamic, co-created space with five rooms, where you can propose sessions, lead discussions, and collaborate in real time..

Whether you come with a specific session to host or simply to be in the flow of the day, your presence will shape what unfolds. We have **several rooms, space for 200–300 people, and an open format**.

## Who Is This For?

- Those working on **the metacrisis, meta-modernism, integral theory, sense-making, regenerative culture, and deep transformation.**
- Academics, educators, and students interested in **bridging radical ideas with institutional spaces.**
- Builders, doers, and system-changers looking for **new collaborators and aligned communities.**

This is a rare opportunity to gather in person, to cross-pollinate ideas across the metacrisis, second renaissance, metamodern, integral, liminal, and related scenes, and to shape the intellectual and cultural foundations of what comes next.

We have **several rooms, space for 200–300 people, and an open format** designed to foster deep dialogue, emergent connections, and tangible next steps. This is a chance to:

- **Meet in person**—after years of online discourse, let's build real relationships.
- **Engage Harvard and the academy**—bring these transformative ideas into spaces of institutional influence.
- **Catalyze projects and movements**—connect across scenes to make real things happen.
- **Seed the Second Renaissance**—a moment to crystallize, cohere, and lay the groundwork for what's next.
