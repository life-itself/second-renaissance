              For our first magazine issue and exhibition we chose the theme of
              Impermanence. Across religions there is often the practice of
              sitting with the impermanent nature of life, from the five
              remembrance to the memento mori, these contemplation allows us to
              grow our wisdom and insight of inter-connectedness.

            We don’t want to just talk about the 2nd Renaissance, we want to
            make it happen. We want to make this new culture come to live. What
            better way to birth a new cultural paradigm than through art?
            <br />
            <br />
            This is the first issue of the Second Renaissance Magazine on the
            theme of impermanence. It is only possible through the  contribution
            of the community work and time. We are grateful to all the
            contributors. The magazine is grounded under the Art of the Second
            Renaissance manifesto and essay.
