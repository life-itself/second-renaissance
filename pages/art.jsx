        Manifesto
      </h1>

      <p>
        We are a collective of artists making art to bring forth the second
        renaissance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are alchemists
        <br />
        We create a new world through our work.
        <br />
        We are the bridge between the dying past and the future unborn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Art is an expression of our consciousness and humanity, this is our path
        of transformation. Life as an art.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what will be an Art for the Second Renaissance? It is the dawn,
        calling us to value interbeingness, awakening, wisdom and
        inner-evolution. Because we believe and witness that there is an innate
        calling in life to be deeply and truly free. A freedom which includes
        and transcends the freedom to have, to feel and to think. A freedom to
        be and become. It is a Liberation.
      </p>
      <p>
        That this life movement can not be repressed by fear, war, terror,
        death, dictatorship. That our ability to understand, love, care and
        contribute is an expression of our intuitive knowledge of the truth of
        our interbeingness. By doing so we become the author of tomorrow's
        future and the priests to the dying past.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-none mt-16">
        <li>
          Our work is to create a space to be with all of it. To be with the
          joy, the darkness, the hope, the sadness, the unknown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our work is to inquire about what would a world that works for
          everyone look like?
        </li>
        <li>
          What would be asked of us to let go and develop for this to be
