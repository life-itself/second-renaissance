**Who/what are the "centres", "tribes", or communities that make up the Second Renaissance ecosystem?**

Why does this question matter? To get a feel for the landscape in terms of what key trends there are; what similarities and differences in approach there are; around what leaders are people gathering (whether those leaders are theories, ideas, practices, traditions, organisations, individuals etc.). Where does there seem to be traction? Where does there seem to be tension? 

> Why do climate tribes matter? Tribes can help people find each other more quickly by communicating values instead of agendas. ...
> 
> Secondly, tribes are a better way of forecasting what the future looks like. By understanding climate efforts as distinct, dynamic networks of talent and funding, driven by a shared set of values, we can better understand the potential of the ideas they advocate for, as well as their risks and shortcomings. ...
> 
> Finally, the most important thing about climate tribes is that they shift the conversation from passive, “true-believer” narratives towards active, action-oriented ones. ... One can be “alarmed” about climate change, as a third of American adults apparently are, and not do anything about it. But you can’t be in a climate tribe without having an opinion about solutions.

# Key Questions

## How do we identify "centres" of the field/"tribes"?

3 options:
- Data-driven
- Gut instinct
- Ask people in some way
(or a combination of the above)

This research into related efforts to map "tribes" is part of our efforts to make sense of the field and identify "centres"/"tribes" (and build on existing work).

## What is a "centre"/"tribe"? 

For example:
  - A community: a group of people that gather in some way whether in person or online, and who are united by some shared values and interests
  - ...

> While the media still portrays climate as a simple question of beliefs, the climate field has long moved on to diversified solutions. Whether one believes in climate change is no longer the interesting question; now it’s “What do you think is the right approach?

> People who work in and around climate don’t all believe the same things. Instead, they inhabit a parallel, mirror world that looks a lot like the non-climate world. Just like in the regular world, there are factions, politics, and competing belief systems.

> Nor do climate people all agree on the right solutions to pursue. In some cases, they believe other tribes are actively harmful to their cause. The enemy, in their minds, aren’t climate deniers, as we might have seen a decade or two ago – they’re other people working in climate.
