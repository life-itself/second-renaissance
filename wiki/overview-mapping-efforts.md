> We sense an emerging ecosystem that is growing. More and more people are talking about what we are calling the "Second Renaissance" ecosystem, although people are using different names, e.g. Metamodern, Integral, Regenerative, Liminal Web, Metacrisis, Game B. More and more people are also trying to map and make sense of this ecosystem, e.g. Catalist, Limicon, Gaianet. There is growing recognition between people who are aware of or part of the ecosystem around practices, thinkers, virtual or physical gathering places, analysis of “what’s wrong” and “what’s needed” – but the ecosystem’s identity is still quite vague and swirling, and may indeed never converge into a single clear identity. [1][https://lifeitself.org/blog/second-renaissance-mapping-and-sensemaking](https://lifeitself.org/blog/second-renaissance-mapping-and-sensemaking)

**What other efforts have been made to map who/what is part of the ecosystem that Life Itself are tentatively referring to as the “Second Renaissance” ecosystem?** This page offers an overview of mapping efforts, acknowledging related efforts by our peers not only to map the ecosystem itself but also to “map the mappers”. 

We gather these together with the intentions of: 

*   piecing together a coherent overview of efforts to map the emerging ecosystem;
*   learning from work that has been done already; and 
*   discerning what to do next with our own mapping efforts so that they make a valuable contribution to the collective field. 

We have split these mapping efforts roughly into a) those that map the Second Renaissance ecosystem or something very close to it and b) those that map something broader that includes the Second Renaissance ecosystem. Given the indistinct bounds of the Second Renaissance ecosystem, there is some fuzziness involved even in this exercise. Furthermore, the unavailability of clear inclusion criteria for most of the mapping efforts makes it harder to recognise the rough boundaries of each of these maps. 

We welcome feedback and other perspectives on our work here.

## Broader Ecosystem Mapping Efforts

We see the following mapping efforts as related but having a scope that spans broader than the Second Renaissance ecosystem. We include them below for the utility of their analysis, and for their contribution in piecing together an overview of how the Second Renaissance ecosystem is situated in relation to other movements, fields, and communities.

### Illuminate: Visualising the Field and Practice of Systems Change

- **🔗 Link:** [https://www.illuminatesystems.org/visualisingthefield](https://www.illuminatesystems.org/visualisingthefield)

- **📅 Date:** 2020
- **📃 Description:** “an affinity map that connects language: how people and organisations are talking about themselves in the field - the words they’re using, the capacity they’re putting forward, what domains they say they are working in, and how those map out across the group that we currently have here. What this map does is then start to cluster the most common terms, for example - **stakeholder engagement** and **facilitation** are most commonly found together, as is **social innovation, collaboration** and **impact measurement**.”
- **🎨 Type:** Graph visualisation
- ❓**Inclusion criteria:** Systems change practitioners/people doing systems change work, as identified through snowball sampling
