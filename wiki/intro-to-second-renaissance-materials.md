## What evidence is there for the idea that we are in a time between worlds?

- "the notion that we are between worlds stems partly from Immanuel Wallerstein’s work on World System Dynamics and partly from Peter Turchin’s analysis of secular cycles of history." (Jonathan Rowson, https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)

## What's wrong? What problem(s) does the Second Renaissance seek to respond to?

- "Education is the root of all more specific crises such as climate change, governance breakdowns, impending war, and social unrest. There is a hidden crisis that is giving rise to the many obvious crises: it is unfolding in our own minds, and within newly complex and problematic dynamics of intergenerational transmission. Take climate change. CO2, fossil fuels, and superstorms are not themselves the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is how we think and make choices concerning those things, and by implication, more importantly, how we will “pass on” certain failed ways of being and knowing to the next generation. If we don’t solve the problem of education none of the other problems can get solved." (Zak Stein, https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)

## What is needed? What does the Second Renaissance call for? And why?

- "social autopoiesis – the process by which society renews itself, including an intelligent patterning of institutional deaths and cultural births. We are called upon to be enlightened undertakers and visionary midwives." (Jonathan Rowson, https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)
- "I argue further that educational innovation is one of the major catalysts of fundamental historical change. Other drivers of history, such as technology, warfare, and economics, presuppose and stem from educational realities. Humans make history when they make intentional changes to the dynamics of intergenerational transmission. This means literally changing how we “pass on” the knowledge, skills, and character traits that make possible the unfolding of what we call history.  When looking at prior times of great change seeking lessons for today, I suggest keeping an eye on things like socialization, enculturation, contexts of human development, dynamics of teaching and learning, and intergenerational transmission. This is all “education”—as I broadly construe it." (Zak Stein, https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)

## How else is the ecosystem described by others?

- an "ecosystem of inquiry and practice". (Jonathan Rowson, https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)
