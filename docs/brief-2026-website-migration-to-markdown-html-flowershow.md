Planning

- [x] Flowershow Self-hosted to Cloud
- [x] Framer to Flowershow
- [ ] Repo reordering
- [ ] Deployment
  - [ ] Remove frontend proxy

### Flowershow Self-hosted to Cloud

* **Will not start with the ecosystem split**; treat it as already decided and out of scope for the first steps.
* **Create a new, clean repo for the FlowerShow Cloud site** and copy only the core Markdown content you intend to keep.
  * Rationale: reduces cognitive load, avoids legacy cruft, avoids risky force-pushes, and makes the new site feel intentional.
* First milestone:
  * Get FlowerShow self-hosted content deploying end-to-end on FlowerShow Cloud.

#### Tasks

- [x] Analyse what is in old site outside of ecosystem
- [x] Copy over base markdown **✅2026-01-20**
- [ ] Migrate nextjs style pages (two of them: index.jsx and map.jsx)
  - [ ] Copy over pages (next)
  - [ ] Convert those pages to markdown
- [ ] Add back in the map?

### Repo refactoring

Want to end up with 2 repos:

- One for ecosystem stuff as per https://github.com/life-itself/community/issues/1210
- This one for the website

What is currently in this repo should really go into ecosystem (and be refactored). Meanwhile we have the new website fairly clean.

Tasks

- [x] Create new repo for ecosystem **✅2026-01-23 at https://github.com/life-itself/2r-ecosystem**
- [x] Push this repo current content to that new repo
  - [x] Clean up branches here first
- [x] Force push the new repo content here from the new repo we have made **✅2026-01-23 https://github.com/life-itself/secondrenaissance is now the new clean version**

### Deploy new site

- [ ] Set up flowershow.app for that ...
- [ ] Switch over DNS
- [ ] Remove front end proxy


## Tidy-ups / themeing

🏆

- [ ] Set favicon
- [x] Flowershow supports nice heros **✅2026-01-21**
- [ ] Nice "2R" theme

# Inbox
