The Oasis is an online space and organizing infrastructure for those who want to take action in alignment with the Second Renaissance. Like an island of water and growth in a desert landscape, The Oasis is a gathering point, a growing settlement, and a staging ground for pilgrims and caravans from all across the land.

The Oasis launched April 2025 and meets every Tuesday for 90 minutes starting at 9am Pacific / Noon Eastern / 6pm Central Europe time, as listed [on the events calendar](/events). Oasis calls hold polarities of *being* (interpersonal connection and relational practices) and *building* (lightweight organizing workspaces for projects), wisdom and action, converging with parallelizing, the cathedral with the bazaar.

## Tents at The Oasis

An Oasis Tent is where *community* meets *project* for catalyzing energy. Tents are self-organized and autonomously run by their leaders, and set a cadence between weekly and monthly for how often they are active in the space.
