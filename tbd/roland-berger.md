# About

Roland Berger is technically a consulting firm, which is involved in a number of different industries, as outlined in this diagram below. 

![[roland-berger-industries.jpg]]

Despite looking like a 'conventional' consulting firm based, or at least one concerned primarily with a  profit motive, they appear to be concerned with systems change. As they put it on their website, "We are convinced that the world needs a new sustainable paradigm that takes the entire value cycle into account."

They thus help business and organizations in a number of different sectors work towards systems change and to improve 'robustness'; they do so by 'providing a holistic set of consulting services using cross-disciplinary teams and the support of our global network'. 

They also publish a lot of material, from articles. They have four different topics: mobility, manufacturing, robust organizations, and sustainability and climate action.

It is worth emphasizing that this organization is somewhat on the fringe. For example, they aim to improve robustness of certain organizations. Thus, they may not be working towards deep systems change; but instead are concerned with slightly transforming the current system, not changing it but making it more palatable to certain pressures. They thus are an interesting organization, and are included because they at least appear to be concerned with some degree of systems change.
## Key People


# Theory of Change

As mentioned, they appear to do a lot of different things, but do seem to be genuinely involved in systems change. They have a unique capacity to potentially transform a lot of the wicked sectors and have a close connection to a lot of actors responsible for many of the problems we currently have. They are a consulting firm, so their theory of change is to guide some of these organizations, and perhaps others which are much more progressive and less extractive, towards a new paradigm.
