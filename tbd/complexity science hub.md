# About 

The objective of the Hub is to host, educate, and inspire complex systems scientists, who are dedicated to make sense of Big Data in ways that are valuable for science and society. The Hub catalyzes research in a network of established scientists and the most creative, talented, and open-minded next-generation academics.
  
The Complexity Science Hub Vienna was founded with the vision to become the focal point of complexity science in Europe. The aim is to provide an exciting, creative environment free of bureaucratic constraints for open-minded visionaries who are brave enough to step out of mainstream science. The Hub will be an incubator and playground for radically new ideas.
  
The Hub operates within an international network of complexity institutions, including the Santa Fe Institute, Arizona State University, the Institute of Advanced Studies Amsterdam, or Sapienza University in Rome. This stimulates an optimal flow of ideas and people, who work together on the most pressing questions of our times.

### Key people

## Theory of Change 

One of their themes is considering the potential of 'societal collapse', and the breakdown of complex systems. How exactly do complex systems endure? How do they adapt? Some of these questions are addressed in this article:  https://www.sciencealert.com/chinas-qing-dynasty-collapsed-for-reasons-that-feel-eerily-familiar
 
As they put on their website: 

Climate change, financial turbulences, worldwide urbanization trends, growing numbers of natural disasters, impacts of fake news, migration: coping with the grand challenges of the 21st century needs a deeper quantitative and predictive understanding of complex systems. The science of complex systems provides us with new methods and novel ways of addressing these systems that were thought to be unintelligible only a few decades ago.
  
Complexity science links state-of-the-art mathematics, modelling, data and computer science with fundamental questions posed from various disciplines, such as medicine, economics, ecology or social sciences, and opens new paths to a deeper understanding of systemic risks, resilience, efficiency, and the requirements for sustainable innovation and creativity.

## Connections 

By asking fundamental questions around the nature of complex systems, they seem to be an important resource for getting an understanding of how the world works. Indeed, they hope to not only understand the world but leverage that understanding through transformation; they seem to believe that the key (or one of the keys) to transformation is greater understanding, and they provide a number of resources to consider this.
