      <div class="text-content">
        <p>Amanda graduated in biomedical sciences in 2015. After getting underwhelmed with the traditional academic research world, she went on to explore different paths. Social impact, sustainable development, conscious entrepreneurship, collective wisdom and more... While traveling to communities like Tamera, she discovered new ways of living and the love for the Earth became her silent inner compass. In 2023 she was recognized as one of the few stewards of the Flow Game practice, and she keeps nurturing communities that also nurture her back. She is curious about how we humans can surrender to the streams of love and eros, in a wise and regenerative way, and she thinks that creating Art in communion with Lover Earth might be one answer.</p>
