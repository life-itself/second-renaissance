## The Collective

This newly formed collective is in an experimental phase that will last six months. The Collective operates based on the principles outlined in the Second Renaissance essays.

It currently brings together four women who unite to serve and create art for the Second Renaissance. The art produced may differ from conventional notions of art, embracing new and unique forms. The collective is a safe place of sisterhood and also a group which takes artistic action together. We envision that in some later stage the collective will open up to more members to join, including men. Yet, as of now, at this embryonic stage, we are choosing to be a small group of women who can commit and be the nurturers of what is to be born.

## Amanda Zamparo

Amanda graduated in biomedical sciences in 2015. After getting underwhelmed with the traditional academic research world, she went on to explore different paths. Social impact, sustainable development, conscious entrepreneurship, collective wisdom and more... While traveling to communities like Tamera, she discovered new ways of living and the love for the Earth became her silent inner compass. In 2023 she was recognized as one of the few stewards of the Flow Game practice, and she keeps nurturing communities that also nurture her back. She is curious about how we humans can surrender to the streams of love and eros, in a wise and regenerative way, and she thinks that creating Art in communion with Lover Earth might be one answer.
