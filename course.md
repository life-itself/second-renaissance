---

Join our  short course *Exploring a Second Renaissance Together*. A guided journey to deepen your understanding of the Second Renaissance, this time between worlds.

**Explore this moment of civilizational crisis and transition we are in, moving from modernity into what comes next in our two-episode online course.** 

> I left this feeling inspired. I especially appreciated getting to talk with others and hearing storiees straight from the heart like Sylvie's about having a child and facing the climate crisis. I feel more connected to myself and to others and a sense of being part of a collective movement. Whilst a single twig may easily break a bunch of twigs are unbreakable!" &mdash; Maria

Led by Life Itself co-founders and Second Renaissance project curators Rufus Pollock and Sylvie Barbier we will cover the following areas:

**Awareness:** Exploring our paths to the second renaissance. How did you come to be interested in this? If and when did you start noticing “cracks” in the foundations? What are the resonances amongst us?

**Renaissance:** Exploring what we see can arise? What kind of views and values do you think are needed going forward? What kind of changes in technology and institutions?

**Seeds:** What are the seeds of the second renaissance? Where should we plant and cultivate them? What kinds of greenhouses? What kinds of pockets of emergence are there?

**The course focuses on supporting your own exploration and discovery using small group discussion and sharing amongst the wider group.**

This format makes it suitable whether you’re a complete newcomer to the second renaissance or already have deep knowledge of the area.
Using dialog and inquiry in small groups with sharing back with the group as a whole. There will be brief introductions to key features of the second renaissance to frame and prompt discussion.
