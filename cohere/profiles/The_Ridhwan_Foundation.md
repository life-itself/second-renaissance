> "The Diamond Approach is a modern-day spiritual path. It brings forth a unique understanding of ancient spiritual wisdom and modern psychology to help students uncover their true potential. The Diamond Approach invites us to discover our inner love of truth solely for its own sakeâ€”you simply need a sincere desire to know what is true about yourself.
> 
> The teachings, practices, and community are a path for self-exploration that support greater self-awareness and a more fulfilling life. Individuals develop a deeper understanding of themselves and true nature."
