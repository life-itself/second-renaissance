>Established in 2008, the CSC is a bespoke consulting firm that leads complex learning and strategies initiatives in the United States and internationally, to advance transformational change. Realizing just societies where all life flourishes requires diverse actors to remediate the fundamental conditions, from which injustice grows informed by and accountable to the people and places most impacted by change.
>
>Based upon ecosystem stewardship, our novel approach, energizes this process, enabling new relationships, exchanges, and critical insights to emerge, informed adaptive action and accelerating sustainable progress on our most complex social issues.
>
>Founder Kiley Arroyo has worked at the nexus of cultural rights, environmental justice, and systems transformation for over two decades in partnership with a diverse cross-section of actors from philanthropy, grassroots movements, government, academia, and private sector – often in tandem to accelerate collaborative learning and coordinated action.
>
>Collaborative learning that is context-sensitive and rooted in intercultural dialogue strengthens this adaptive capacity, enhancing the shape and substance of progressive practices, public policies, and investments. Creative strategies support transformational change by shifting the atmosphere, enabling individuals to encounter difference, engage in meaningful dialogue, share truths, develop mutual understanding, and find common cause. 
>
>The CSC was born after a decade of work with NGOs, McKinsey & Company, Demos, and UNESCO and a first hand awareness of the unrealized potential for a more diverse cross-section of system actors to engage in strategic collective action and scale.
