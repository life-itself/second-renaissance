>Culture Hack Labs (CHL) is a not-for-profit consultancy that supports organizations, social movements and activists to create cultural interventions for systems change.  
  >
>Our process is based on an integrated set of tools and techniques to track, research and intervene in cultural narratives. We capture and map large volumes of social data using the Culture Hack Platform. We then analyze the networks, language, and deep logics to develop insights and content to evolve culture.
>
>CHL was born out of a decade of research and development in narrative-led culture change work viaÂ The Rules, an activist collective focused on addressing the root causes of inequality through narrative and cultural interventions.
>
>We operate as a decentralized network of researchers, movement leaders, social scientists, strategists, artists, communications & political strategists, and technologists.
>
>We come together to create narrative interventions that cut to the heart of the dominant culture.
