Larger Us is an organization dedicated to overcoming some of the psychological and emotional hurdles that exist in our current world, and they aim to make a more common sense of 'oneness'. As they put it on their website, they are "a community of change-makers who share the aim of bridging divides rather than deepening them, who want to transform relationships rather than defeat enemies, and who recognize that achieving these things is about psychology as much as politics.''

Initially, the organization formed in response to Brexit. Over the years, they changed from just publishing research to becoming "a co-created space for learning, sharing ideas, and asking the biggest questions about how we become a larger us rather than a them-and-us at a moment when everything depends on our ability to come together at all levels from neighborhoods to nations."

Larger Us is interested in people and organizations who recognize the humanity in ‘the other side’, and what motivates them to act as they do; are willing to listen and reach out beyond their usual support base; understand and act on the inner change needed to do this emotionally demanding kind of work.

## Theory of Change

Becoming a larger us "involves both inner and outer work". As cliche as it sometimes sounds, they believe that this is the time to foster connections opposed to division. This diagram comes from the *5 Key Questions for Change Makers* report, which also goes into further detail about their theory of change. Ultimately, there is a focus on the individual and how we relate to one another; and fostering the emotional and relational capacities to create a more collaborative future.
