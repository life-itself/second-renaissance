> ThoughtBox is a community of educators and systems-thinkers, helping us learn how to care for ourselves, each other and the planet. We are leading thinkers in education regeneration, working with schools to support a healthier culture of learning through leadership training, curriculum and practitioner-programmes - all centred around a Triple WellBeing approach.
