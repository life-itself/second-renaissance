>We are a civic tech non-profit organisation, with headquarters based in Tallinn, Estonia, and a second office in Jakarta, Indonesia, both of which are working on a local level, but also running together many international projects.
>
>Our mission is “To empower as many people as possible to participate in respectful, meaningful discussions in order to collaboratively decide on issues that affect their wellbeing.”
>
>We focus on two things:
>
>1. Building and maintaining a **secure and open-source collaborative decision-making platform for civic initiatives**, which is provided **free of charge** to anyone who wants to use it. The online platform allows for deliberative discussions, collaborative decision-making and voting in situations where it is either impossible or inconvenient for participants to be in the same room, and –
>2. **Running participatory e-democracy projects**, which together serve as the driving force behind our commitment to creating a society where every voice matters, and collective decisions are shaped by the collective will of the people.
