>**UNESCO Chair on Futures Literacy at Hanze University of Applied Sciences**
>
>As Chair we commit ourselves to the implementation of Futures Literacy in Higher Education through research and a wide range of practices. The development of these programs, the lessons learnt, the tools for evaluation and the carefully designed principles, have put the UNESCO Chair at Hanze at the top of global educators regarding futures literacy. More and more students, and professionals from all over the world find their way to our programs. The Chair has become a leading voice of advice in long term learning trajectories due to experience in mapping learning journeys in futures literacy.

>Since the Futures Literacy Intensive Program in 2016 the Team at Hanze has expanded her activities with research and development, training programs and long term projects and parterships. The overaching aim is to empower the next generation and to foster resilience and openness to emergence in higher education and beyond.

>The Community stretches beyond the Chair's network partners and consist of alumni and friends of the Global Futures Literacy Network.
