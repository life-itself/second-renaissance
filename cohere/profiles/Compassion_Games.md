>The Compassion Games International is a year-round non-profit initiative incorporated in Washington State.

>Compassion Games offers fun and creative ways to ignite and catalyze compassionate action in communities around the world. In the annual Compassion Games, **competition becomes _coopetition_** as teams and individuals challenge one another to strive together to make our planet a better place to live through community service, acts of kindness, and raising monies for local causes. The Games amplify what is already working in our communities and inspires increased engagement, leading to new activities that bring compassion to life and improve our well-being. [...]

>The Compassion Games adapt creatively to any community who wants to embrace and play them. Since 2012, players of the Compassion Games have served over 15,000,000 people in more than 40 countries by over 1,000,000 reported volunteer players. The Games have been played between cities, businesses, faith and interfaith organizations, schools, and even prisons. Participating teams in the Compassion Games perform acts of kindness and service, reporting on the number of volunteers, hours of service, money raised for local causes, and the number of people served, providing measurable results that can be improved upon, year after year.

>**How Can Compassion and Play Change the World?**
>
>Compassion is an antidote to the fear, disconnection, and social isolation of our time. Scientific research abounds in revealing the intrinsic human necessity for compassion to flourish in our personal, professional, and civic lives. As a profound source of power within each of us, playing with compassion inspires us to connect authentically with one another, rejuvenating our spirits as we _actively live into a positive vision of our world, together_.
