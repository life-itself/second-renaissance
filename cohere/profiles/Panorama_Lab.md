## Theory of Change

### Influences & Inspirations

"We have developed a comprehensive methodology, founded on the decades of work of the leading minds of our time in the areas of integral theory, organizational development, organizational psychology, holistic marketing and management, sustainable territory development, and even holistic medicine. Our methodology is based on the researches of Ken Wilber, Mee-Yan Cheung-Judge, Robert J. Marshak, Gervase R. Bushe, Arthur Koestler, Claire Graves, Robert Keegan, Richard Barrett, Suzanne Cook-Greuter, and many others."
