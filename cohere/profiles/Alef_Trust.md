Nurturing the Fields of Change report: https://www.aleftrust.org/publications/nurturing-the-fields-of-change-report/ 

>This report presents the results from an inquiry into the living dynamics of holistic change facilitation. Over the course of two years (2020-2021) we journeyed with thirteen holistic change facilitators who were part of our Conscious Community initiative and who were facilitating projects worldwide. The inquiry brought to light how holistic change facilitators approach their work, what challenges they can encounter, and what support they need to successfully navigate projects through complex emotional and relational terrain.
