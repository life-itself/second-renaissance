>We are a non-profit organisation based in Germany that is passionate about indigenous wisdom. Our team lives in many countries all over the world and we work fully digitally.
>
>Our goal is to foster education and maybe even “development aid” to the western world through indigenous knowledge. And we help indigenous communities to set up projects that help them to preserve their culture and knowledge. [...]
>
>Some indigenous peoples still live today in the deep self-understanding of being custodians of the earth as human beings. They remind us of how we become effective co-creators in the service of the unfolding of life on earth. We want to contribute to remembering this potential and to grow into this role.

>One of the central goals of our association is to buy back land and regenerate it with indigenous knowledge. We believe that we need to embrace indigenous knowledge systems again and apply this original knowledge to our modern times. In doing so, we explore indigenous approaches in a practical way and test their relevance for current challenges
