>The non-profit organization Terre & Conscience offers events, learning and training in the fields of permaculture, agroecology, biodynamics, vegetable gardens, transition and ecopsychology… in order to strengthen our connection to nature, the earth and the living and thus participate together in the project of transforming the world.
>
>It all started in 2009. For a long time, already very involved with her husband Dominique in the "Wisdoms & Conscience" programme of the non-profit organization Tetra, Claire has had the intuition that it is urgent to reconnect with nature, that the different crises that humanity is going through are essentially linked to a lack of meaning, awareness and connection to the laws of life. It is time to learn to care for the earth by learning ancestral gestures mixed with the latest techniques such as agroecology, biodynamics, permaculture… let’s finally dare to experience wonder, cooperation, sharing, abundance!
