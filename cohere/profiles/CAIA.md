>An ECO City Village (ECO CiVi), a real-world laboratory for the village of the future, is being built in the village of Steyerberg, near Hanover.  
 > 
>We develop concepts for sustainable design and evaluate the research applied. This knowledge is then available to everyone as a blueprint. Through exchange and collaboration together with like-minded initiatives and projects, we bring extensive practical knowledge to sustainable practices.  
  >
>Not only does ECO CiVi offer perspectives for the development of functioning local circulation systems working at the intersection of consciousness, science and culture, it also offers a laboratory that supports economic, ecological, social and cultural change.

## Key People

- Jürgen Weber, Mayor of the Flecken Steyerberg since 2013

## Theory of Change

Their philosophy is centred around the need for a "societal shift in consciousness":

>The greatest transformative force on our planet is the human being. Therefore, he is the starting point for the transition to a sustainable and healthy world.
>
>Throughout the world, for thousands of years, mankind has grappled with the issue of becoming conscious. Findings from philosophy, anthropology, quantum physics and many other disciplines have shaped our current patterns of thought, behavior and our mindset.
>
>The globalized world is closely interconnected, but consciousness is fragmented. Humans must use their capacity for reflection to develop a consciousness that thinks holistically. This is the key to a sustainable future.
>
>A societal shift in consciousness is needed so that humanity can once again learn to support this planet in a more nurturing way.
>
>We need to move from an ego understanding in which we humans focus on the well-being of just ourselves, to a system that respects and includes all parts of the ecosystem and emphasizes the well-being of the whole.
