> "The MIND Foundation envisions a healthier, more connected world through evidence-based, safe, and legal applications of the psychedelic experience.
> 
> - We support and conduct high-quality psychedelic research.
> - We translate science into everyday language to support people in living healthy and meaningful lives.
> - We work with policymakers to create safe and legal environments for the psychedelic experience.
> - We train professionals and educate the public on psychedelic treatments, integration, evidence-based harm reduction, and human development.
> - We encourage communities to build beneficial, knowledge-based, and risk-aware attitudes around psychedelics.

> The MIND Foundation is a European non-profit registered under German law (HRB 220247 B). [...]

> At the MIND Foundation, we navigate the intersection of human development, mental health, and sustainability through a unique framework anchored in the concept of Bewusstseinskultur, or "culture of consciousness." This approach, developed by neurophilosopher Thomas Metzinger, blends critical thinking, meditation, and psychedelic practices into a practical ethos for individual and societal transformation. 
> 
> In order to place psychedelics in the center of society, we strongly believed that we had to pursue the medical model, hence becoming a key partner in Europe’s largest psilocybin study for treatment resistant depression (TRD) and opening Germany’s first augmented psychotherapy clinic. 
> 
> Now, our goal is to cultivate human flourishing by connecting psychological well-being with sociocultural progress."
