>COP² is a global network of organisations, reflecting the knowledge, practice, activism, lived experience and traditions that go into bolstering the ‘social climate’ and emotional resilience that we need to care for a sustainable earth.
>
>We are mental health systems innovators, community leaders, advocates, researchers, practitioners in sustainability and wellbeing economy and more. We need all of these strands to shift global levers of power for nurtured people to nurture the planet.
>
>The COP² network is anchored through six regional hubs; advised and supported by a Provisional Steering Committee and Secretariat; and led by the Billion Minds Project at Columbia University. [...]
>
>The name (COP²) accents the need for **“Care of People and Planet,”** and the added power (“squared”) that comes through centering communities as places that nurture and care for people, who in turn care for the planet.
