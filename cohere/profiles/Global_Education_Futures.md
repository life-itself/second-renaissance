> Global Education Futures is a path breaking and paradigm forming initiative that takes on the challenge of exploring, experimenting, emerging, and engaging systemic innovation for lifelong and lifewide learning.
> 
> By fostering the emergence of living learning communities, and bringing these communities into connection with each other to form socio-technical learning ecosystems, we are paving the way for a new brand of human to emerge.
> 
> What We Do: The way we work is by cooperating with our partners to co-create projects that have positive impact in education and on society as a whole. We create visions for education and share and apply these visions collaboratively.
> 
> Our focal areas of interest include skills of the future, learning ecosystems, empowering learners of all ages and creating prototypes for educational change.
