>Our everyday is peppered with impromptu, emergent, participatory events. Think improv workshops, music jams, all-nighter philosophy discussions, salons for your daily cosmetic and intellectual routine, sports (indoor, outdoor, inside out), movie screenings, talks… to name the most conventional happenings.
