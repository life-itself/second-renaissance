>We live in an era of perma-crisis (climate, societal, warring of all kinds). Over these six years, The Alternative has found that the remedies are available—but scattered. The systems we are embedded in—media, economic, political—take our power away. So how do we achieve the world we know, deep down, is possible?
>
>Planet A offers you a place to re-orienate, pull the strands together and build. Feet on the ground; mind, body and spirit in the emerging possible. Here you can experience futures organising, future economies and future flourishing in the present moment, ready to converge in a town or city near you.

Their main activities are:
- publishing a daily newsletter 
- initiating and supporting Community Agency Networks or Citizen Action Networks (CANs) 

### Organising principles

- Cosmo-localism - focusing on the needs of communities in their specific contexts while also recognising spiritual connectedness of people across differences
- I-We-World - recognising interconnectedness
- Parallel Polis - imagining alternative possibilities

## Theory of Change

They identify a need for personal development practice in order to cultivate response-ability for the future.[1][1]
- Key question: "How can we develop our internal strength sufficiently to stay focused on the regenerative future arising?" 
- "if you keep company with others who can see the green shoots of a better future, this gives confidence where there was none before. Gaining and giving attention to new forms of intelligence and agency enlivens any space. Transforming our experience of living on this planet in real time."
