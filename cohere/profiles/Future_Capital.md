> 
> The inaugural gathering of the Future Capital was held at the United Nations in New York, September 12–13, 2019. The Design Team included members of the UN Office of Partnerships, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and the World Academy of Art & Science (WAAS).

> We are dedicated to developing a fully operational and fully conscious global economy.
> 
> We find ourselves at a precipice. A reductionist world view has created a culture of disparity and possessiveness that threatens the future of humanity. The Future Capital initiative is focused on restoring the right relationship between consciousness and capital, as creative force and constructive resource.
> 
> Building from a foundation of higher consciousness and radical kindness, Future Capital recognizes and honors all types of capital. We are convening individuals and organizations to manifest a conscious economic model that can deliver health, well-being, and prosperity in support of mutual interdependence for all beings including the Earth.
> 
> Future Capital is a formative assembly and a call to action for a momentous collective breakthrough. We are bringing together an extraordinary cross-disciplinary blend of global leaders carefully selected for their expertise and demonstrated actions. Our goal is to amplify, cross pollinate, and create a common platform and language that will resonate across cultures, demographics, and stakeholders.
