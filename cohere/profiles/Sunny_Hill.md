> Sunny Hills of Istria is a project that aims for the sustainable revitalization of the rural area of Slovene Istra.
> 
> Association Sunny Hill organises workshops, retreats, conferences and events immersed in pristine nature, away from the hustle and bustle of the cities but still, only half an hour away from tourist centres on the Slovene and Croatian Adriatic coast.
> 
> Cooperative Sunny Hills of Istria offers the venue. 200 years old traditional building where the events take place was fully renovated in 2016 and exhibits sustainable solutions such as compost toilets, reedbeds for wastewater treatment, clay plasters and more.
> 
> Cooperative and association are entangled in a vibrant community that hosts long and short-term volunteers who help with the household, maintenance, gardening and whatever is on the to-do list at a time.  Cooperative members, volunteers and long-term guests live and work together in luxurious simplicity following four guidelines: agreement of people, the harmony of space, the resonance of life, and joy of co-existence.
> 
> Luxurious simplicity is a concept of a simple lifestyle that doesn’t restrict us from the basic comfort of modern times.  We share tools and cars, we try to buy only necessary stuff, repair, upcycle and recycle whenever possible, buy bulk, produce our own food and cook together. We are trying to be conscious of how our actions affect the environment, other humans and other living beings.
