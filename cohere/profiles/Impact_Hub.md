>Impact entrepreneurs face various challenges in growing their organisations,  including securing sufficient capital and talent, meeting market demands, and enhancing efficiency. Organisations, on the other hand, grapple with fostering innovation and collaboration among stakeholders from the public, private, and civic sectors to drive systemic change on critical issues like climate change and inequality.
>
>**We bridge these gaps by co-creating actionable interventions that deliver tangible impact.**
