## Theory of Change 

Earth4all suggests that there are two possible futures: 'too little too late' and 'The Giant Leap'. They are advocating for the 'giant leap', and they expand on what that entails here:

>This scenario assumes societies embark on a new path to a sustainable world by 2050. What if we fundamentally reconfigure our economies, energy and food systems so that they work for both people and the planet? Climate change, financial turbulences, worldwide urbanization trends, growing numbers of natural disasters, impacts of fake news, migration: coping with the grand challenges of the 21st century needs a deeper quantitative and predictive understanding of complex systems. The science of complex systems provides us with new methods and novel ways of addressing these systems that were thought to be unintelligible only a few decades ago.
