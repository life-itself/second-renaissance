>**The Lunt Foundation** promotes regenerative solutions growing wealth from the perspectives of ecology, well-being and community.   
  >
>Through our work, we seek to contribute to the elevation of collective consciousness for a more harmonious and loving world.   
  >
>Currently, our work focuses on supporting holistic health models, the development of constructive journalism and the evolution of consciousness among leaders and influencers. These three focal points are intimate and intersectional.

>**The idea of a foundation** sparked after Michael Lunt and Guibert del Marmol attended the Skoll Forum in Oxford in 2012, a place and a moment where social entrepreneurs from around the world gather to connect with like-minded people, share ideas, and find partners. During the Forum, Michael and Guibert were amazed to witness the emergence of a new world that very few people knew about. This experience gave them a newfound enthusiasm and desire to answer the question: “How can we support these individuals engineering new and necessary models for our society?”.

>**On the train ride back, they sketched out the initial concept that would allow them to materialize their vision**. The idea was to support disruptive pioneers to communicate, tell their story, and facilitate collaboration and financing opportunities.
