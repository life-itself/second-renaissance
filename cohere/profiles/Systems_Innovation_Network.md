Our purpose is to build the worldâ€™s capacity for systems innovation, so as to better understand and address complex challenges and co-create a world where systems work for all.

>We work to advance the area of systems innovation in theory and practice through awareness raising, the development of educational content, a community of practice and the development of spaces for collaboration around key challenges.

The platform contains many educational resources. The network also offers different 'hubs', organised around different themes/sectors. One example is the "Cities Hub" which shares information on systems change for cities, in which there are roughly two posts a week, mostly from moderators, on content about cities and systems innovation. The platform seems to have a good amount of involvement.

## Theory of Change 

- They understand "systems innovation" as "a new approach to innovation that tries to tackle complex social and environmental challenges through the use of more holistic & innovation driven approaches. It is a kind of innovation that aims to change  the underlying structure of a system, thus potentially enabling a more transformational kind of change"
