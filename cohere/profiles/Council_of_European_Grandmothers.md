> We are Elder Women who have decided to form a Council of nurturing power, natural wisdom and willingness to do our part to support, achieve and maintain a healthy living environment â€“ in our time, for the children, grandchildren and future generations.
> 
> From our perspective, everyone deep inside has access to her/his natural wisdom that knows what to do in every breath, to support the living system on Earth. Our intentional vision is to support that capacity and encourage people to perceive and use their wisdom.  
> 
> Every nine months we meet in one of our European countries. At each meeting we focus on a special topic and also spotlight local projects related to this. Together with guests and visitors we share, inspire and strengthen a field of peace and acceptance where inner wisdom arises. This supports the living system where we all belong. 
> 
> We call ourselves The Council of European Grandmothers.
