### Vision 

>The vision of Integral Politics is a society in which the well-being of all people, all animals, all plants and the whole earth is realized. [...]
>
>This integral society is based on a changed consciousness of people who know that everything is connected to everything else and that there is enough for everyone. [...]
>
>People act from a constructive, life-affirming responsibility - from the intelligence of the heart.

## Theory of Change

### Integral Politics

>Originally coined by the philosopher Jean Gebser and developed above all by Ken Wilber , the term “integral” today has many facets. It represents a new cultural era and a conscious way of life. 
>
>**For us, “integral” means**
>- integration and equivalence of the four levels of being
>- identification with consciousness
>- cohesion, everything is linked
>
>**Our political identity**
>- We don't defend special interests.
>- We aspire to a culture of sharing, solidarity and dignity for human beings and their environment.
>- We are committed to the well-being of all human beings, regardless of ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, language or social status.
>- We protect the needs of all living beings, animals and plants.
>- For us, politics is a service activity that draws up rules for human coexistence and relations with the surrounding world, and submits them to the appreciation of our fellow citizens.
>- Political positions are defined on the basis of future visions and images of an ideal, integral society.
>- We train ourselves not to know.
>
>**We encourage a change of mentality**
>The heart of our activity is to promote the transformation of people's consciousness in the direction of a decrease in egocentricity and an increase in cooperation, openness and globality. Human beings assume radical responsibility for the creation of their own lives.
