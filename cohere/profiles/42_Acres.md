> We use our deepest intuition, ancient tools and shared knowledge to establish [[regenerative]] spaces, curate transformational experiences, and foster opportunities to learn, heal and grow.

(https://www.42acres.com/)

> 42 Acres was first conceived in 2015 by siblings Lara and Seth Tabatznik as a home for personal, social and environmental change after having been deeply inspired number of powerful personal retreats and workshops in their own lives. Including processes such as the Hoffman Process, Satori, Non-Violent communication workshops as well as working with plant medicines. Both Seth and Lara are strong advocates that outer change in the world starts with the self, or to quote [[Gandhi]]; “Be the change that you wish to see in the world”.‍  
  >
> At its core, 42 Acres continues to invite people to reconnect with nature, self and others but has now grown to offer so much more including a range of [[wellbeing]] and [[nature]] based experiences and events, a biodynamic farm and an abundant nature reserve.

## Key People

- Seth Tabatznik, Co-founder
- Lara Tabatznik, Co-founder

## Theory of Change

Beyond sustainability into regeneration:
- Their definition of regenerative: "Being regenerative means being carbon negative and biodiversity positive. Put simply, we aim to leave the earth in better shape than when we found it–not only for us but for generations to come." [2][2]
- They take a regenerative approach to farming, using principles from: agriwilding, organic farming, biodynamic farming, and permaculture. [1][1]

Their approach to food and farming sees **human and environmental health as one and the same**, and so caring for one is caring for the other:
- "As we cultivate and restore the wellbeing of our planet Earth, we cultivate and restore the wellbeing within ourselves." [1] [1]
- "We believe that the soils in which we grow food and our guts in which the food ends up, are one and the same. Since the health and contents of the soil will inevitably end up in our bodies, we should treat them with the same care." [1][1]

They take a **hyper-local** approach to food:
- They aim to source at least 80% of their food from within 42 miles.
- They aim to source c.5% of their food through wild foraging
The  focus on local is because "local means less packaging, less footprint, more seasonal, fresh and better relationships with our community" [1][1] as well as supporting the local economy. 

## Transformational tools and practices

- [[Hoffman Process]]
