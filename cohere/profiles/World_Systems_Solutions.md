> Our Vision is that through conscious collaboration, we will unite, organize, mobilize and align humanity in common purpose to find a solution to the climate crisis. Together as a global collaborative community, we will generate a global sustainable future via intelligent application of technology and resources. 
> 
> In a nutshell, we are developing an AI based global platform that helps organize the international community work together effectively and to offer them all the necessary tools, knowledge and resources to solve the climate crisis.

> We see conscious collaboration as the comprehensive antidote to climate change and main requisite attainment for humanity if we want to be able to protect the environment and generate a sustainable future for every living person and the natural world. [...]

> Drawing upon all the capabilities of humanity effectively and efficiently in a paradigm of harmonious collaboration will empower all individuals and nations to fundamentally transform, and to do so in a way that they can recognize to be beneficial, healthy and wholesome. Without this approach, the existing paradigm of non-collaborative world function is too dysfunctional, inefficient and disharmonious to the ecosystem to successfully continue, even into the near future.
