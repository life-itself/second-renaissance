> We are a pioneering adult education center dedicated to develop a Global Integral Competence. We provide learning programmes for adult learners which help them to develop not only the skills to be competitive and ready for a new world of work, but more importantly to develop the capacity to analyse and understand global and intercultural issues. Our focus is to assist in creating and facilitating innovative and engaging learning solutions for the development of social and emotional skills, as well as values like respect, self-confidence and a sense of belonging. One of the distinctive qualities of our organisation lies in our commitment to the ‘Integral Approach,’ a specialized methodology that underpins our programs. This approach encompasses a holistic perspective, integrating various dimensions of human experience into a cohesive framework.
