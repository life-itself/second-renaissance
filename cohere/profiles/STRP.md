>STRP explores the relationship between art, technology, and major societal issues with the general public, artists, designers, media makers, and thinkers. The Eindhoven-based organisation starts a dialogue about speculative future scenarios with various events throughout the year and an annual festival in the spring.  
 > 
>Since 2006, STRP has been offering new scenarios for the future, dialogue sessions, a festival, an international exhibition, workshops, tours, an extensive educational program, music and performances. Every year we co-produce several new works of art in collaboration with emerging artists.
