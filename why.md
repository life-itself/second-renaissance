title: Why Map? Why this Project?

Short answer: mapping is a first step in building an emerging field/movement and we want to build a field/movement for inner-led paradigmatic change -- for a second renaissance and awakening societies!

More near-term: Establishing a field brings credibility. It means having a name, having an area with well defined participants etc. Right now, we don't even have a common agreed name or key principles for what defines this emerging movement. That makes it hard to "find the others", to get resources, to be seen from outside the area etc.

For more on the former see below.

## Deeper Why

### Overall context: transition to a new cultural-social paradigm

Our thesis & theory of change goes something like:

- Want to evolve to next paradigm(s) ("awakening" / "teal" / "metamodern" / ... pick your term)
  - Why? (Can discuss)
- Questions that arise from that - see https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/02/01/cultivating-an-emerging-paradigm for background and more detail
  - What *exactly* is that next paradigm(s)
  - How does evolution/transition to it happen?
  - Where are we in that process of evolution?

### How does transition happen and where are we in the process of transition?

Let's focus on those last two: how does the transition happen?  And where are in the process?

A rough answer would be that a new paradigm has to be born and mature. This looks something like this:

> [!note]
> 
> This is not necessarily linear e.g. can loop back, can get stuck or fall back.

- Stage 1: new ideas, practices emerge (arrive / arise). Few isolated individuals or very small groups
- Some connections start to form
- Then naming / self-awareness and more active networking
- Communities of practice & intentional communities
- Strategic out-group engagement (ongoing throughout on an upward gradient)

> - Berkana
> - 3 horizon model
> - Social movement theory / revolutions + civil wars/intra-state conflict
> https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-introductiontosociology/chapter/theoretical-perspectives-on-social-movements/ 
> - Discourse coalitions

### The ecosystem mapping helps in several parts of that transition

Things the ecosystem mapping help inform / answer

- Where are we at in the process of evolution of this “movement”
- What is this "movement?"
- The very act of mapping / displaying helps crystallize the field/movement -- the 2nd stage of field development in our list above
